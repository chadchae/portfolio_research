   abstract = {Although previous studies on human resource management (HRM) research trends in the global context provided very useful information about the structures of HRM research trends, they have critical limitations. Despite the growing contribution and significance of HRM practices in Korea, a dominant group of scholars has rarely focused on what is going on in the research community in the country. To overcome the limitations and fill the gaps found in studies on the global HRM trends, the purpose of this study is to conduct the keyword network analysis investigating the semantic network structure composed of Korean HRM studies. A total of 1158 research papers published by three top peer-reviewed HRM journals in Korea that were published from 2007 to 2018 were analyzed. The result shows that the whole network structure of Korean HRM has a complex semantic structure that is socially constructed. Additionally, this study identified the top 10 prominent keywords and its ego-centric networks, and nine thematic clusters. By adopting keywords network analysis in bibliometric methods, this study provides an accurate structural interpretation of Korean HRM research practice to facilitate the sustainable development of the studies on the global HRM trends.},

During the collaboration, authors exchange their knowledge, resources, and information. Co-authors' repeated relationships generate trust, norms, and networks, thereby creating positive values. To investigate patterns and characteristics of the human resource development (HRD) scholars' collaboration networks, this study applied social network analysis (SNA). The exponential random graph model (ERGM) was used to analyze the influence of structural determinants of co-author collaboration networks that appeared in four major HRD journals from 1990 to 2014. Empirical results confirmed that AHRD co-authorship displays both the small-world phenomenon and a scale-free network whose network-formation processes are influenced by authors' mutual and transitivity-related closure relationships, including multiple 2-paths and edge-wise shared partners. Implications for how author collaborations must be understood and encouraged are also discussed.},

   abstract = {The usefulness of current psychiatric classification, which is based on ICD/DSM categorical diagnoses, remains questionable. A promising alternative has been put forward as the “transdiagnostic” approach. This is expected to cut across existing categorical diagnoses and go beyond them, to improve the way we classify and treat mental disorders. This systematic review explores whether self-defining transdiagnostic research meets such high expectations. A multi-step Web of Science literature search was performed according to an a priori protocol, to identify all studies that used the word “transdiagnostic” in their title, up to May 5, 2018. Empirical variables which indexed core characteristics were extracted, complemented by a bibliometric and conceptual analysis. A total of 111 studies were included. Most studies were investigating interventions, followed by cognition and psychological processes, and neuroscientific topics. Their samples ranged from 15 to 91,199 (median 148) participants, with a mean age from 10 to more than 60 (median 33) years. There were several methodological inconsistencies relating to the definition of the gold standard (DSM/ICD diagnoses), of the outcome measures and of the transdiagnostic approach. The quality of the studies was generally low and only a few findings were externally replicated. The majority of studies tested transdiagnostic features cutting across different diagnoses, and only a few tested new classification systems beyond the existing diagnoses. About one fifth of the studies were not transdiagnostic at all, because they investigated symptoms and not disorders, a single disorder, or because there was no diagnostic information. The bibliometric analysis revealed that transdiagnostic research largely restricted its focus to anxiety and depressive disorders. The conceptual analysis showed that transdiagnostic research is grounded more on rediscoveries than on true innovations, and that it is affected by some conceptual biases. To date, transdiagnostic approaches have not delivered a credible paradigm shift that can impact classification and clinical care. Practical “TRANSD”iagnostic recommendations are proposed here to guide future research in this field.},

   abstract = {The increasing participation of women in the medical field seems to be a universal phenomenon across countries. However, the gender gap in leadership positions is still prevalent due to a stereotype and career barrier. In this study, we aimed to investigate what female physicians experienced in their career development in academic medicine in Korea. This investigation focuses on their lived experience, including support or obstacles in their career. We used a qualitative research approach based on grounded theory. Twenty one female physicians participated in individual interviews. Through constant comparison process during open coding and axial coding, several themes were emerged from the data. The themes include (1) Limited choice of specialty in early career, (2) Commitment to work and work-life imbalance, (3) Social and cultural impact on career development, (4) Individualism overlooks gender discrimination, (5) Negative career aspiration to be a leader and a vicious cycle of a lack of social networking, and (6) More female physicians but culture change varies. The current study has provided a potential framework that helps one understand some aspects of career challenges for female physicians in Korea academic medicine. The simple increase in the number of women doctors has not affected fundamental cultural changes. Nevertheless, increase in diversity in academic medicine brings inevitable changes in organizational culture. Given the weak social network and role models for leaders, planned changes to develop female physician leaders is imperative.},

   abstract = {Context Gender inequality remains prevalent worldwide in academic medicine. A closer look into women physicians’ gendered experiences through the lens of culture is necessary to advance understanding of gender inequality in this context. Relatively few studies, however, have investigated how social and cultural practices implicitly yet significantly affect gender inequality throughout women physicians’ careers. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the lived experiences of South Korean women physicians working in academic medicine and to focus on social and cultural influences on the gendered process of their career journeys. The study will extend our understanding of gender inequality in academic medicine through an in-depth analysis of social and cultural practices that affect the phenomenon. Methods We conducted a qualitative study utilising a grounded theory approach. Twenty-one women physicians participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were recorded, transcribed and analysed through a process of constant comparison using grounded theory to extract themes. Results Junior women physicians were more vulnerable to gender discrimination and channelled to ‘ghettos’ through the seniority-based, patriarchal, collectivist and business hospital culture in South Korea. Under pressure to excel at work, they had no work–family balance and experienced identity crises as competent doctors and mothers. They felt themselves to be ‘othered’ in multiple cultural contexts, including school ties, rankism and a culture of after-work gatherings. Minimal levels of leadership aspiration created a vicious cycle of a lack of social networking and mentoring. Pursuing individual excellence, they attributed their struggles to personal choices and rarely sought organisational support. Conclusions The dynamics of cultural and social practices constantly and implicitly recreate mechanisms to maintain gender inequality in academic medicine in South Korea. Planned culture changes at individual, organisational and national levels are imperative to discontinue the vicious cycle that exists in the labyrinth of women physicians’ career development in academic medicine.},

This study aims to trace the significant thematic periods, called the wave in the evolution of HRD, from its early development days to the present. In doing so, we present how “the body of HRD knowledge is evolving through the intellectual evolutionary process” based on analyses of widely cited definitions, influential work, and connections among co-appearing research topics. As the finding, we identified three distinctive waves of evolutionary phases of HRD research: (a) developing definition of disciplinarity, (b) competition and selection between major paradigms, and (c) divergence and expansion of topics. Major characteristics of each period and the influence between periods were also described.},

A practical case is made to use SNA in the HRD context. After an analysis of hypothetical network data and application of social capital theory, the case shows how some actors in the network can create social capital from strong supportive relations, whereas others might expect to gain brokerage advantages by playing a role in structural holes.

Combined effects in the variable set were analyzed using conditional process analyses (Hayes, 2013). Findings The results indicate that POS positively affects OCB and KSI, and that JCs moderate the relationship between POS and OCB. Also, the relationship between POS and KSI is mediated by OCB, and the hypothesized moderated mediation model is confirmed. Originality/value This study is novel in empirically establishing how employees’ KSI is affected by POS as an integrative construct bringing together JCs and OCB. This paper intends to fill a methodological gap and nurture future research by adopting conditional process analyses assessing whether JCs moderate the relationship between POS and OCB and mediate the effects of OCB on KSI.},

   pages = {921-939},
   abstract = {Purpose – This study has adopted theoretical frameworks of social capital, social networks and the Community of Practice to study how different types of relationships influence the knowledge sharing relationship. This paper aims to suggest that building social capital, particularly structural capital, is part of expected key in knowledge sharing networks.
Design/methodology/approach – Using social capital theory, through social network analysis of 111 management students in the US business school, identified key social capital dimension in knowledge sharing networks. To incorporate the interdependency among examined relationships, network logistic regression with the quadric assignment procedure was used.
Findings – The proposed research model showed that about 98% of the existence of knowledge sharing relationship could be correctly predicted. Among three dimensions of social capital, this study found a superior influence of the structural dimension (i.e. task interdependence) in predicting having a knowledge sharing relationship. The significant effect of trust and friendship network on knowledge sharing was also found. Implications for practice and suggestions for future research were also discussed.
Originality/value – Existing literature as to how people learn through knowledge sharing is limited in at least two important ways. First, scholars of knowledge management acknowledge that organizational knowledge originates from dyadic relationships between or among individuals at work. However, prior research has heavily relied on survey responses from one’s perception of knowledge sharing experience, viewing as unidirectional. Second, substantial attention of prior research has been devoted to the factors of individual attributes. Emphasizing individual interactions as the fundamental building blocks of learning, this study focuses more on relational characteristics of knowledge sharing based on social capital theory.},

Findings This research uncovered distrust, personality differences, generational differences in views, scheduling issues and technology difficulties as the top five inhibitors for virtual team creativity and success. The authors identified seven main strategies for developing virtual team creativity and success. The authors found that building “team norms” and guidelines to encourage positive interactions between team members can facilitate team creativity. In addition, a concept of trust-based open communication was identified as one of the important strategies when teams actively use technology-mediated communication tools. Practical implications Organizational practitioners can use the results of this study when developing knowledge to establish assessments regarding which employees possess the appropriate characteristics to lead virtual teams and implement virtual team training.

In January 2014, transitional housing units (THUs) began operating in six of the state correctional institutions. The THU was designed to provide reentry services to inmates who will be released to geographic areas near the institutions, thus allowing for contact with outside agencies that can provide ongoing support services for community reentry. The THU was chosen as the reentry program of study because this type of evaluative research has not been conducted in the THU in the past from the perspective of an inmate preparing for community reentry. An Enhanced Critical Incident Technique (ECIT) was used to examine what helps and hinders inmates that are living in the THU who are preparing for community reentry. A study group of 30 men living in the THU will be identified for interviewing to explore their lived experiences of community reentry preparedness. Each participant was asked how they define community reentry preparedness /what community reentry preparedness means to them, and what helps and hinders, and might help (wish list items) community reentry preparedness. ECIT analysis of participant responses result in the identification of critical incidents, helping incidents, hindering incidents, and wish list items (WL items).

   title = {Understanding the evolution of international human resource management research: A bibliometric review over the past 25 years (1995-2019)},
   abstract = {Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs bibliometric analysis to examine the evolutionary path of international human resource management (IHRM) research from 1995 to 2019. A dataset of 1,507 articles from journals specializing in IHRM, international business, and general management was created. Analysis at the keyword, thematic, and network levels was conducted to identify trends, historical context,
and the interrelatedness of research themes.
Purpose: The aim of this paper is to offer a comprehensive overview of the field of IHRM research by tracing its evolutionary development over a 24-year period. The study seeks to understand how the field has progressed, by considering historical research themes and their subsequent integration into more recent scholarly work, thereby identifying the current and emerging research trends.
Findings: The analysis reveals that IHRM research has gone through several phases of thematic focus, from initial emphasis on cultural differences and expatriate management to more recent topics like global talent management and digital transformation. Earlier research themes continue to be incorporated and re- contextualized in modern scholarship, highlighting the field’s dynamic nature.
Originality/value: This paper is one of the first to use a bibliometric approach to systematically examine the evolution of IHRM research. It not only provides a historical perspective but also outlines future research trends, incorporating the institutional logic perspective. The findings offer deep insights that are valuable for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in the development of IHRM research and its practical implications.},

   abstract = {In accelerated globalization, multinational corporations (MNCs) continually seek
opportunities to expand their businesses to foreign countries. For sustainable businesses in
foreign countries, it is important to retain a large number of local employees which is
challenging. Based on existing literature in international human resource management, we hypothesized that organizational commitment (OC) is a mediator in the relationship between
perceived career growth opportunity (CGO) and turnover intention (TO) among local
employees in MNCs. We analyzed a sample from five companies affiliated with a Korean
MNC located in Vietnam. From the mediation analysis, it was evident that OC is a partial
mediator between CGO and TO. In particular, CGO and OC were positively correlated, OC
and TO were negatively correlated, and CGO and TO were still negatively correlated when
OC was adjusted in the regression model. These findings provide a new insight in the field of
international human resource in growing MNCs.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a strict 100-day lockdown period in Spring of 2020 in China. One of the consequences of the lockdown was the disruption of the food supply chain for the millions of people confined to their homes. The well-established online food delivery service (OFDS) in China were disrupted by pressure to scale up rapidly to resolve the last mile of food delivery. The importance of the OFDS during periods of crises became apparent, as did the realization that uninterrupted food distribution was only possible due to the presence and scalability of the existing delivery network. Focusing on the importance of an established OFDS as a foundation for food distribution, this paper seeks to explore factors that affect consumers’ perception and acceptance of the retail food delivery system in urban China. By applying the extended theory of planned behavior (TPB), mean value calculation, univariate linear regression, and multiple linear regression have been adopted to test the hypotheses. Data obtained online from 260 participants demonstrate that the software’s characteristics concerning hedonic motivation (HM), convenience motivation (CM), perceived ease of use (PEOU), navigational design (ND), information quality (IQ), privacy and security (PS), restaurant credibility (RC), and perceived severity (Psev) have positive and significant impacts on customers’ intention to use (ITU), and thus, affects the actual use (AU) of the application in a positive way. The findings of this research contribute to the existing literature by consolidating, validating, and extending the TPB model, especially under the large-scale public health crisis circumstances. Customized practical insights are provided to emphasize developing HM, CM, Psev, and RC factors with maximal marginal effects that promote consumer acceptance; this is a prerequisite to the development of a robust OFDS. which can be repurposed during periods of crises to provide sustainable last-mile food delivery networks.},

   abstract = {One requirement for sustainable economic development is established, trusted, and utilized financial institutions to facilitate investment. The rapid development of financial markets in China, combined with the recency and magnitude of middle-class wealth, has resulted in a rapidly changing investment landscape, as well as changes in people’s investing activities. The extent to which economic growth is sustainable will depend, at least in part, on how financial institutions are perceived, as well as the extent to which they are utilized. The objective of this study was to examine the investment behaviors of individual investors as a way to ascertain the perceived level of trust and stability in the relatively recently developed financial institutions. The influence of market information acquisition on asset allocation and value investment in China was analyzed. This study used secondary data from a China securities corporation from previous research. The analyses utilized the general decision-making style test to assess respondents’ decision-making models and quantitative research methodology culminating in the use of correlation analysis. The results indicated that the acquisition of market information had a positive correlation with the number of assets and investment portfolios. Practical implications and suggestions for future research are provided. The results may be of interest to individual and institutional investors in China, as well as those with an interest in current trends in market information acquisition, asset allocation, and value investment in China.},

   abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify how intervention research weighed in nonintervention research in the field of human resource development (HRD) by examining the number, citation frequency and use of experimental studies in HRD academic journals. Design/methodology/approach A total of 2,700 articles published between 1990 and 2014 from Advances in Developing Human Resources (ADHR), European Journal of Training and Development (EJTD), Human Resource Development International (HRDI) and Human Resource Development Quarterly (HRDQ) were reviewed and analyzed to identify 91 experimental studies in the field. Findings The total citation frequency of the 91 articles was 1,100 (14 from ADHR, 222 from EJTD, 56 from HRDI and 808 from HRDQ). The authors reviewed the 1,100 subsequent studies that cited 91 experimental research studies and coded them to identify the research methods that each article adopted and to determine whether the studies used the citation to make causal statements. As a result, the authors found 459 causal statements from 1,100 citations. In particular, they identified the citation frequency of the causal statements used in nonintervention research to examine how often nonintervention studies used causal statements from intervention studies. Research limitations/implications The results of the citation frequency could be different according to the search engines and timeframes. Books, technical reports, non-English studies, non-academic articles and inaccessible articles were not considered in this study. Theoretically, this study aimed to illuminate the magnitude of HRD experimental research conducted over 25 years and to what extent it influenced non-experimental studies. In addition, this study emphasized the importance of using the causal statements from experimental research to improve empirical validation in other studies. Practical implications When HRD practitioners need to identify alternative interventions to replace previous ones or to justify the use of specific interventions, they could consider causal statements from empirical studies as valid evidence. Further, HRD practitioners might collaborate with researchers to receive more direct and relevant information from experimental research. Originality/value Significantly, this study provides an integrative review of experimental research conducted in the field of HRD in terms of the number, citation frequency and proportion of using experimental research. An additional contribution is that it summarizes the research methods used in HRD studies over 25 years.},

   abstract = {Workers in the U.S. construction industry experience workplace hazards that can lead to work-related injuries that sometimes are fatal. Reported in this paper is a case-control study of risks factors associated with 4,845 injured workers and their work environments that led to fatal rather than nonfatal injuries during 2015-2017. These injury data originally were assembled from information collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that were used in a machine learning competition, but were repurposed for this secondary analysis of injury risks. Sixty-one percent of workers recorded in this dataset were injured fatally. Multiple logistic regression was applied to model the probability of a fatal injury as a function of the nature of the injury, part of body injured, human factors involved, whether the injured worker was carrying out a regularly assigned task at the time of the injury, and the manner in which the injury was inflicted. Related positively, relative to benchmarks, to the probability of a fatality injury were: falls and strikes; electrocution; asphyxiation and drowning; injury to the head and neck; and working at a task not regularly assigned. Negatively related to the probability of a fatal injury were: chemical/temperature burns; amputation and crushing; fractures and dislocations; injuries to fingers, hands, wrists, and other extremities; and falls from an elevation or to the same level, although this last negative relationship is anomalous in the light of independent research findings. Findings of this study do not necessarily culpable causes of work-related death. Rather these findings identify risk factors that might prove fruitful for further analysis of the incidence, severity, and costs of construction injuries.},

   abstract = {A topic model was explored using unsupervised machine learning to summarized free-text narrative reports of 77,215 injuries that occurred in coal mines in the USA between 2000 and 2015. Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling processes identified six topics from the free-text data. One topic, a theme describing primarily injury incidents resulting in strains and sprains of musculoskeletal systems, revealed differences in topic emphasis by the location of the mine property at which injuries occurred, the degree of injury, and the year of injury occurrence. Text narratives clustered around this topic refer most frequently to surface or other locations rather than underground locations that resulted in disability and that, also, increased secularly over time. The modeling success enjoyed in this exploratory effort suggests that additional topic mining of these injury text narratives is justified, especially using a broad set of covariates to explain variations in topic emphasis and for comparison of surface mining injuries with injuries occurring during site preparation for construction.},

The field of inquiry of meta-science emerged originally in reaction to problems with reproducibility and replicability of seemingly settled science. These same problems could affect research evidence conducted by human resource development (HRD) researchers and, as a result, could limit the applicability of HRD research outcomes to HRD practice.The SolutionDiscussed in this article are examples of meta-scientific issues and solutions that ultimately affect the transition of knowledge derived through research to practice in the field of HRD. Problems with the reproducibility and replication of research conducted in the field are detailed as are meta-scientific issues involved in judging the quality of scientific work, methodology-agnostic applications of meta-scientific inquiry, requirements for sharing data and code, and the need to let theory guide research.The StakeholdersResearchers would benefit from the considerations of meta-scientific concerns in the design, conduct, and reporting of research to improve the replicability and reproducibility of research outcomes. Knowledge of meta-scientific principles and cautions by adopters of research outcomes would inject healthy skepticism into decisions about whether research outcomes are worthy for application in practice or to guide future research.},

   abstract = {In this study, we investigate how high- and low-performance learners (N=12) act differently while using a cognitive tutoring system. We examine three research questions: (1) Can we predict learners’ performance using only their visual attention (eye movement data)? (2) Can we predict learners’ performance from visual attention data and initial performance? (3) Are age, gender, first language, where they look, and the sequence of Areas of Interests (AOIs) significant factors in the learners’ performance? Learners more correctly answer questions taken from larger rather than smaller AOIs. Our results show that high-performance learners pay more attention to the content that contains answers to later questions. Surprisingly, the tutor did not change the learners’ visual search to a goal-oriented search. Our analyses can help instructional designers create a more productive learning experience because visual search behavior as part of a learner model with acceptable accuracy in early stages can be used in adaptive tutors. Additionally, we trained a classifier on the eye movement data to predict learners’ performance for each question. Its results provide a list of suggestions for designing more productive learning experiences, such as enticing user attention by increasing the size of the content that contains answers and changing the order of contents.},

   abstract = {본 연구는 최근 우리 사회와 기업에서 빈번하게 언급되는 ‘꼰대’와 그 문화적 현상을 탐색하고 조직문화 차원으로 해석할 목적으로 이뤄졌다. 조직문화 상징주의에 의하면 언어는 한 집단의 문화가 투영된 산물이므로, 꼰대라는 은어가 국내기업 조직문화 현주소를 보여주는 단서가 될 수 있다고 가정하였다. 이를 위해 기존에 조직문화를 탐구한 국내 연구를 통시적으로 검토하고, 꼰대라 지칭되는 현상이 발원된 문화적 맥락을 검토하였다. 기존 연구를 종합하면, 국내 조직문화는 역사적으로 수직적-수평적 문화, 집단주의-개인주의 문화, 온정주의-성과주의 문화간에 긴장 상태가 지속한 것으로 보인다. 본 연구는 이들 간의 충돌 사이에서 꼰대라는 은어가 표출된 것으로 해석하였다. 지금까지 이 현상을 탐구한 선행 연구가 거의 없으므로, 본 연구는 한국 직장인들이 활용하는 소셜 미디어의 빅데이터를 분석해서 조직구성원들이 주관적으로 인식하는 꼰대 및 꼰대문화를 탐색적으로 살펴보고자 하였다. 이를 위해, 최근 조직 및 인사 연구에서 적용되고 있는 구조적 토픽모델링 등의 텍스트마이닝(text mining) 방법론을 활용하였다. 분석 결과, 꼰대는 위계와 권력 구조를 지칭하는 단어들과 함께 나타났고, 부정적인 감정이 수반되는 경향이 있었다. 자신의 직급이나 권위를 앞세우고, 개인 차이를 인정하지 않으며, 무능하지만 조직에서 중요한 자리를 차지한 인물 또는 집단을 지칭하는 용어로 활용되고 있었다. 또한, 꼰대는 ‘젊은’이라는 형용사와 빈번하게 호응하는 것으로 나타나, 꼰대가 비단 나이 많은 관리자 또는 고령 구성원만을 지칭하는 표현이 아니라는 점이 드러났다. 마지막으로, 꼰대와 꼰대문화를 주관적으로 인지한 이들은 통계적으로 유의하게 본인 회사의 조직문화를 부정적으로 평가하였다. 본 연구는 오늘날 한국기업 조직문화 현상에 예리한 관심을 두고 이를 이해하기 위해, 사회적으로 널리 활용되는 은어와 그에 내재한 주관적 심상을 대규모 텍스트 데이터로 분석하여 탐색했다는 측면에서 학문적 기여가 있다고 할 수 있다.

The purpose of this study is to explore the phenomenon of kkondae and to interpret it for Korean companies from organizational culture perspective. The important evidences for understanding the Korean society and company can be ‘kkondae’ and its culture in that the it has been used more frequently to explain various social phenomena. Nevertheless, few existing academic studies have been conducted, so this study analyzed the big data of social media that Korean employees has used the most. We also looked at the perception of kkondae and its cultures in various aspects through text-mining methodology such as topic modeling. As a result, interest in kkondae has increased explosively in Korean society since 2017, and most of cases in the organization have been used as terms to refer to superiors in the organizational structure, those who enforces norms and goals of the group, and those who take up their seats despite their lack of ability. Next, those who subjectively recognized kkondae and its culture tended to underrate their organizational culture. These results can contribute to academia by suggesting that if the members who were dissatisfied with the organizational culture recognized the members who worked together as kkondae, the probability could be high. In addition, it is meaningful that kkondae do not exist simply as old people, but can be recognized as kkondae by their attitudes and values, which can be presented to the members through human resource activities.},

COVID-19가 팬데믹(Pandamic) 수준으로 선포 되기 이전에 구성원들은 리더들이 내재적/외재적 보상에 더욱 공을 들이고 수평적 조직문화를 만들어주기를 기대한 반면, COVID-19 시대에는 심리적 안전감, 잦은 소통, 미래에 대한 방향성 제시 등을 요구하고 있었다. 이와 같은 위기 상황에서 부각되는 리더십을 본 연구자들은 변혁적 리더십으로 간주하고 두 번째 연구를 설계하여 구성원들의 태도변수인 회복 탄력성과 관계를 실증했다. 회복 탄력성은 위기 상황에서 구성원들이 갖춰야 할 요소로 자주 언급된다. 변혁적 리더십이 COVID-19 시대에 도 회복 탄력성에 유의미하게 영향을 미치는지 살펴봤다. 분석 결과, 변혁적 리더십은 회복 탄력성과 정(+)의 관계를 가지고, 정서적 몰입은 변혁적 리더십과 회복 탄력성의 관계를 부분적으로 매개하였다. 본 연구는 COVID-19 이후로 요구되는 위기 리더십을 데이터로 규명했다는데 실무적으로 기여점을 가지고 있다. 더불어, 위기 상황에서 종종 강조되는 구성원 태도인 회복 탄력성과 관련성을 실증했다는 이론적인 기여점이 있다.},
