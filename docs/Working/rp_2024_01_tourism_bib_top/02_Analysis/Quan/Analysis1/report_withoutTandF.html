The analysis report demonstrates—with extensive performance, network, and thematic mapping analyses—that research in tourism is increasingly concerned with how travel experiences shape subjective well-being, quality of life, and overall happiness. In parallel, the proposal argues that the field remains fragmented, with isolated studies examining hedonic (pleasure-focused) versus eudaimonic (meaning-focused) aspects. Together, they build a case for a more holistic understanding of tourism’s multifaceted impact on human well-being. This perspective is essential as it calls for integrating both psychological and socio-economic dimensions to inform policy, practice, and further academic inquiry.</a></li>

By merging perspectives from positive psychology, economics, sociology, and management, the research field is poised to develop richer, more nuanced models of well-being. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances theoretical development but also offers practical benefits for policymakers and industry stakeholders. For example, insights from the analysis report—through network and factorial analyses—show how diverse academic traditions intersect, suggesting that collaboration across fields can drive innovations in both tourism experience design and well-being enhancement.</a></li>

One of the main challenges is operationalizing subjective constructs like happiness and well-being in a standardized and comparable way. On the innovation front, the proposal advocates for a combination of bibliometric methods, qualitative content analysis, and machine-learning techniques (such as structural topic modeling) to map research trends and uncover latent intellectual structures. The analysis report further demonstrates how network analyses (co-citation, bibliographic coupling) and factorial analyses can reveal the underpinnings of tourism research. These methodological innovations not only help in capturing complex interrelations but also pave the way for more robust, data-driven evaluations of how tourism contributes to happiness.</a></li>

<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Gradual Emergence (1992–2005)</strong>:<br>
The number of articles is very low in the early years, ranging from 0 to 2 per year, with a small uptick to 5 in 2006.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Steady Uptick (2006–2015)</strong>:<br>
From 2006 onward, there is a gradual climb in publications:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 articles in 2006<br>
</li>
<li>10 articles by 2010<br>
</li>
<li>29 articles by 2015</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Significant Surge (2016–2024)</strong>:<br>
The publication count shows a substantial rise during this period:</p>
<ul>
<li>53 articles in 2016<br>
</li>
<li>98 in 2019<br>
</li>
<li>142 in 2020<br>
</li>
<li>191 in 2022<br>
</li>
<li>342 in 2024</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Partial Data or Drop in 2025</strong>:<br>
After a record high in 2024 (342 articles), the count is <strong>50</strong> in 2025, which might indicate data for 2025 is <strong>incomplete</strong> or still being collected.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">

<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mean Total Citations per Article (MeanTCperArt)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Higher values appear in earlier years (e.g., <strong>178</strong> in 1996, <strong>195</strong> in 2004), while more recent years show much lower values (e.g., <strong>3.13</strong> in 2024, <strong>1.44</strong> in 2025).<br>
</li>
<li>This reflects the <strong>longer timespan</strong> older articles have had to accumulate citations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Number of Articles (N)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Sparse in the early years (often <strong>1</strong> or <strong>2</strong> articles).<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Substantial increase</strong> in later years, with <strong>342</strong> articles in 2024 and <strong>50</strong> in 2025 (notable jump compared to single digits in the 1990s).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mean Citations per Year (MeanTCperYear)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Fluctuates from <strong>2.88</strong> (1992) to peaks around <strong>8.86</strong> (2004) and <strong>8.14</strong> (2011).<br>
</li>
<li>Generally, older articles show higher mean citations per year, likely indicating influential or foundational research.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Citable Years</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The table shows a <strong>gradually decreasing number</strong> of citable years as the publication date moves closer to the present (e.g., <strong>34</strong> citable years for 1992 vs.&nbsp;<strong>1</strong> for 2025).<br>
</li>
<li>This aligns with the notion that newer articles simply haven’t had as much time to be cited.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Influence of Older Publications</strong>:<br>
Articles from the 1990s and early 2000s show high average citations, suggesting they may be <strong>seminal works</strong> or foundational studies that have consistently been cited over decades.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Citation Accumulation Over Time</strong>:<br>
The <strong>longer an article has been available</strong>, the more citations it tends to accumulate. Hence, recent publications (especially post-2020) naturally exhibit lower citation counts and lower mean citation rates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rapid Growth of Publications</strong>:<br>
A <strong>significant increase</strong> in the number of articles in the 2010s and early 2020s indicates <strong>expanding research activity</strong>. More scholars entering the field and greater research funding can lead to a higher volume of new work, though these new papers typically need time to garner citations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disparities in Citation Rates</strong>:<br>
Some specific years (e.g., 1996, 2004) show unusually high average citations, possibly indicating <strong>particularly influential articles</strong> published in those years.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>
<p>In summary, <strong>older publications have accrued more citations</strong> and thus show higher average totals and yearly citation rates. Meanwhile, the <strong>volume of recent publications</strong> has grown substantially, but these newer papers have had <strong>less time to gather citations</strong>. Consequently, the dataset shows a <strong>maturing field</strong> where both the <strong>quantity of research</strong> and the <strong>range of citation impacts</strong> continue to expand.</p>

<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Zonal Distribution</strong>: According to Bradford’s Law, the journals are divided into three zones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zone 1 (Core)</strong>: Ranks 1–6, where each journal has the highest frequency of articles.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Zone 2</strong>: Ranks 7–19, which collectively contribute the next significant portion of articles.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Zone 3</strong>: Ranks 20–92, comprising the largest set of journals but each contributing fewer articles individually.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Zone 1 Journals (Ranks 1–6)</strong></p>
<ol type="1">

<li><p><strong>Clear Core Group</strong>:<br>
Zone 1 journals (the top six) are widely recognized as <strong>key outlets</strong> in tourism research. Their high article frequencies signify their <strong>central role</strong> in disseminating foundational and cutting-edge studies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secondary But Still Significant Contributors</strong>:<br>
Zone 2 journals each have notable publication counts, reinforcing their status as important, although slightly less central, <strong>publication avenues</strong>. They often cater to particular subfields or combine tourism with other related disciplines (e.g., hospitality, recreation, or destination management).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long Tail in Zone 3</strong>:<br>
The largest cluster includes many specialized or regional journals. While each has fewer publications, collectively they offer <strong>diverse perspectives and niche contributions</strong> to the field. This distribution aligns with Bradford’s Law, showing how research output is concentrated in a small number of core sources, with a wide array of additional journals making smaller but collectively significant contributions.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>
<p>By applying Bradford’s Law, we see a <strong>high concentration of articles in a small group of journals</strong> (Zone 1), followed by a moderately sized set (Zone 2), and a broad “long tail” (Zone 3).</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong>, the data confirm that a <strong>few core journals</strong> (Tourism Management, Journal of Travel Research, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, etc.) dominate the field, while many other journals contribute essential but more specialized insights. This distribution reflects a <strong>mature academic domain</strong> in which recognized flagship journals coexist alongside numerous specialized outlets, together shaping the multi-faceted landscape of tourism and hospitality scholarship.</p>

<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>High-impact Leaders</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tourism Management</strong> (h-index = 54) stands out with the highest h-index, followed by <strong>Annals of Tourism Research</strong> (40) and <strong>Journal of Travel Research</strong> (40).<br>
</li>
<li>The g-index values follow a similar pattern, with <strong>Tourism Management</strong> (g = 98), <strong>Annals of Tourism Research</strong> (73), and <strong>Journal of Travel Research</strong> (74) at the forefront.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Total Citations (TC) and Number of Publications (NP)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tourism Management</strong> again tops the list with <strong>9,706 total citations</strong> across <strong>108 publications</strong>, reflecting both <strong>volume</strong> and <strong>influence</strong>.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Annals of Tourism Research</strong> (TC = 6,712; NP = 73) and <strong>Journal of Travel Research</strong> (TC = 5,595; NP = 97) also show high visibility and citation impact.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>m-index (Years Normalized)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tourism Management</strong> and <strong>Journal of Travel Research</strong> share a high m-index of <strong>2.35</strong>, indicating that even when controlling for how long they’ve been publishing in this dataset (PY_start), they maintain strong citation momentum year over year.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Journal of Sustainable Tourism</strong> (m = 1.89) also exhibits a robust rate of accumulating citations since 2008.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Emerging or Specialized Journals</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many journals further down the list have lower h-index and g-index scores (e.g., h-index &lt; 10). Some have relatively high m-index values despite lower absolute citation counts, indicating <strong>rapid growth</strong> within fewer years of publication history (e.g., <em>Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management</em>, h=18, m=1.8, started in 2016).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Core Influence of Established Titles</strong>:<br>
The highest h-index and g-index values cluster around <strong>long-standing, flagship tourism journals</strong>, confirming their role as <strong>core venues</strong> where influential and widely cited research is published.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Role of Publication Timeline</strong>:<br>
The <strong>m-index</strong> (which normalizes the h-index by publication years) reveals that <strong>newer outlets</strong> can still accumulate citations rapidly if they publish high-impact studies. For example, <em>Tourism Management Perspectives</em> (m = 2.09, started in 2015) has gained traction quickly, suggesting it’s an emerging high-impact venue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Breadth of Field Maturity</strong>:<br>
Journals with moderate or low h-index/g-index but strong niche focus (e.g., <em>Information Technology &amp; Tourism</em>) indicate the <strong>specialized sub-areas</strong> within tourism scholarship. They may have fewer articles overall but still contribute valuable, specialized insights.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Influence of Journal Age</strong>:<br>
Some older journals (e.g., <em>Annals of Tourism Research</em>, started 1992) have large total citation counts thanks to <strong>decades-long</strong> scholarship. In contrast, newly launched or recently included journals may show lower overall metrics simply due to <strong>less citation-accumulation time</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>
<p>The data reinforce the <strong>dominant local impact</strong> of long-established tourism journals, particularly <strong>Tourism Management</strong>, <strong>Annals of Tourism Research</strong>, and <strong>Journal of Travel Research</strong>. They feature the highest h-index and citation counts, underscoring their <strong>central role</strong> in advancing tourism scholarship. Meanwhile, newer or more specialized journals can still exhibit a strong <strong>m-index</strong>, reflecting <strong>rapid citation growth</strong> in emerging areas.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong>, the local impact indicators (h-index, g-index, m-index, total citations) demonstrate a <strong>well-defined hierarchy</strong> of core tourism journals while highlighting the potential for newer outlets to build influence quickly through highly cited research.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lotkas-law">Lotka’s Law</h4>
<p>Lotka’s Law is a fundamental principle in bibliometrics and scientometrics, which are fields concerned with the quantitative study of scientific and technological literature. Named after Alfred J. Lotka, who proposed the idea in 1926, this law describes the frequency with which authors publish in a particular field.</p>
<p><strong>Lotka’s Law</strong> can be represented mathematically as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Y = \frac{C} {X^{\alpha}} \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Where:
<ul>
<li>$ Y $ is the number of authors making $ X $ contributions</li>
<li>$ C $ is a constant (it describes the number of authors making only one contribution)</li>
<li>$ $ is a constant usually close to 2 (though it can vary depending on the discipline).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpretation of Lotka’s Law:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Majority Publishes Once</strong>: A large number of authors will have only one publication, which corresponds to the value of $ C $.</li>
<li><strong>Decrease in Frequency</strong>: As the number of publications per author (i.e., productivity) increases, the number of authors who have published that many times decreases, and this decrease is very sharp (often described as an inverse square law).</li>
<li><strong>Few Prolific Authors</strong>: Only a very small number of authors will be responsible for a large portion of the publications in a particular field. This can be thought of as the “80-20” principle, where a minority (often around 20%) of authors produce the majority (around 80%) of the work.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Application:
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify Core Authors</strong>: By applying Lotka’s Law, organizations and researchers can identify the core authors or the most prolific contributors in a particular field or topic.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis of Scientific Output</strong>: Lotka’s Law can be utilized to analyze the scientific output of a field, helping in recognizing the distribution of productivity among authors.</li>
<li><strong>Research Evaluation</strong>: Research institutions might use this principle to evaluate the research output of their faculty or departments, understanding the distribution of prolific authors versus those who publish less frequently.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s worth noting that while Lotka’s Law provides a useful general observation about scientific productivity, there are variations depending on the specific scientific discipline or field of study. The values of $ C $ and $ alpha $ might differ across disciplines, and in some cases, other bibliometric models might offer a better fit to the data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Measurement for the Lotka’s law is the following:
<ul>
<li>N.Articles: This is the number of articles written by an author.</li>
<li>N.Authors: This is the number of authors who have written the corresponding N.Articles.</li>
<li>Freq: This is the frequency (proportion) of those authors relative to the total number of authors.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<p>The table shows how many authors have published <em>N</em> articles, alongside the <strong>frequency</strong> of authors for each <em>N</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highest Frequency at N=1</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>2613 authors</strong> (80.20%) have just <strong>1</strong> article, the largest group, indicating a “long tail” of contributors.<br>
</li>
<li>This high proportion of single-publication authors is typical in many scholarly fields, aligning with the <strong>inverse-square</strong> or <strong>inverse-power</strong> distribution suggested by Lotka’s Law.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gradual Decrease for Higher N</strong>:
<ul>
<li>As the number of articles authored (<em>N</em>) increases, the number of authors contributing that many articles <strong>decreases sharply</strong>. For instance:
<ul>
<li>2 articles: 377 authors (11.57%)<br>
</li>
<li>3 articles: 106 authors (3.25%)<br>
</li>
<li>5 articles: 31 authors (0.95%)<br>
</li>
<li>Very few authors produce <strong>more than 10</strong> articles.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Very Productive Authors</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Only <strong>1 author</strong> has produced <strong>27</strong> articles, one has <strong>22</strong>, and one has <strong>20</strong>, illustrating the pattern in which a <strong>tiny minority</strong> of authors contributes a <strong>large volume</strong> of publications.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Classic Power-Law Behavior</strong>:<br>
The table demonstrates a <strong>steep power-law</strong> (or Lotka-like) distribution, where <strong>most</strong> authors publish <strong>just once</strong>, while <strong>a small subset</strong> of highly productive authors accounts for many publications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Field Maturity and Broad Inclusion</strong>:<br>
The large proportion of single-publication authors signals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Field Openness</strong>: Many researchers (possibly from adjacent disciplines) publish occasionally in this domain.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Potential Collaboration</strong>: Some of these single-publication authors may be graduate students or co-authors with senior researchers, indicating a collaborative environment.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Identification of Core Authors</strong>:<br>
A handful of authors consistently publishing 10+ articles are likely <strong>key influencers</strong> or <strong>thought leaders</strong> in the research area. Their high productivity positions them at the center of scholarly discourse.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>
<p>The data conform well to <strong>Lotka’s Law</strong>, illustrating a typical <strong>author productivity</strong> pattern: 1. <strong>Most</strong> authors publish <strong>one</strong> article only.<br>
2. A <strong>much smaller group</strong> demonstrates <strong>moderate</strong> productivity (2–5 articles).<br>
3. An <strong>extremely small cohort</strong> of authors achieve <strong>high</strong> productivity (10+ articles).</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong>, these findings highlight a <strong>highly skewed</strong> productivity distribution common in scientific fields, where <strong>a majority of authors</strong> contribute a single study, and <strong>a small group</strong> drives a significant fraction of the total output.</p>

<li>PY_start: The year of the author’s first publication.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>High-Impact Leaders:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>UYSAL M</strong> stands out with an h-index of 16 and g-index of 27 from 27 publications (TC = 3007) since his first publication in 2013. His m-index of 1.23 indicates robust citation accumulation per year.</li>
<li><strong>NAWIJN J</strong> (h = 14, g = 15, NP = 15, TC = 1219, PY_start = 2010) and <strong>FILEP S</strong> (h = 13, g = 22, NP = 22, TC = 582, PY_start = 2012) follow as influential authors in the dataset.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Diverse Productivity and Citation Profiles:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some authors, like <strong>SU LJ</strong> (h = 13, m = 1.18) and <strong>KIM H</strong> (h = 10, m = 0.91), show a solid balance between publication output and impact.<br>
</li>
<li>In contrast, <strong>LEE CK</strong> (h = 11, m = 0.48) has a longer career starting in 2003 with 13 articles, but a lower m-index indicates slower yearly citation accumulation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Varied Career Stages:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The starting years (PY_start) range from as early as 2003 (e.g., LEE CK) to more recent years such as 2020–2021 (e.g., ALRAWADIEH Z, WEN J), reflecting both long-established and emerging voices.</li>
<li>The m-index (TC/NP normalized by career length) helps compare authors across different career spans, revealing that more recent authors can achieve high annual impact even with fewer publications.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Citation Impact vs.&nbsp;Publication Volume:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A high h-index and g-index generally point to a consistent influence of an author’s work. For instance, UYSAL M’s metrics (16/27) reflect that many of his 27 articles are highly cited.<br>
</li>
<li>Authors like NAWIJN J, with 15 publications and an h-index of 14, demonstrate that nearly every publication has contributed to his citation profile.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Normalized Productivity (m-index):</strong>
<ul>
<li>The m-index gives insight into the annual impact. UYSAL M’s m-index of 1.23 is particularly strong considering he started in 2013, meaning he has averaged a good citation rate each year.<br>
</li>
<li>Lower m-index values (e.g., LEE CK’s 0.48) can be attributed to a longer career span where earlier publications may have had less impact or a slower rate of citation growth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Field Evolution and Emerging Scholars:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Authors with later start years (e.g., ALRAWADIEH Z, MITAS O) and relatively high m-index values suggest that newer contributions are quickly gaining recognition.<br>
</li>
<li>The range of indices across authors reflects the interdisciplinary and evolving nature of the field, where both established researchers and newer entrants contribute to its growth.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>
<p>The local impact metrics reveal a <strong>hierarchy of influence</strong>: - <strong>Core leaders</strong> like UYSAL M, NAWIJN J, FILEP S, and SU LJ have achieved high citation impact relative to their output, indicating that their work is both prolific and influential. - <strong>Normalized indices (m-index)</strong> help account for differences in career duration, showing that newer authors can be very impactful on an annual basis. - Variations in metrics among authors with similar publication counts (NP) underline differences in citation performance and influence.</p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong>, the data show a skewed distribution where a relatively small group of authors achieves high impact (reflected by high h- and g-indices and m-index values), while others have moderate performance. This pattern is typical in many academic fields, indicating that a few key researchers drive the bulk of the influential scholarship.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="affiliations-production-over-time">Affiliations’ Production over time</h4>
<p>The table provided represents a bibliometric analysis of the production of articles related across different universities and university systems over a span of approximately two decades. Here’s an elaboration and interpretation of the results for each institution:</p>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<p>The table displays the yearly article output for several key affiliations in tourism research. Notable patterns include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delayed Start &amp; Gradual Onset:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many institutions (e.g., <strong>Kyung Hee University</strong>, <strong>Hong Kong Polytechnic University</strong>, <strong>University of Queensland</strong>, and <strong>State University System of Florida</strong>) show no production in the early 1990s through the early 2000s.<br>
</li>
<li>Production begins modestly (often 1–2 articles per year) in the mid-2000s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Steady Increase with Recent Acceleration:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Over time, article counts gradually increase. For example, <strong>Kyung Hee University</strong> increases from 2–5 articles in the 2003–2013 period, reaching 13–14 articles by 2019–2021, and then leaping to 39–40 articles in 2024–2025.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Hong Kong Polytechnic University</strong> similarly grows slowly until around 2014–2015, then accelerates dramatically: from 10 articles in 2016 to 90–97 articles by 2024–2025.<br>
</li>
<li>Other affiliations, such as the <strong>State University System of Florida</strong> and <strong>University of Central Florida</strong>, show a similar pattern—little or no output in the early years and then a rapid ramp-up in the 2010s, peaking in the early 2020s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Variation Among Institutions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>While some institutions like <strong>University of Queensland</strong> and <strong>Sun Yat Sen University</strong> also show an upward trend, the magnitude and pace vary.<br>
</li>
<li>For instance, <strong>Universidade do Algarve</strong> had negligible output until 2017 and then a marked increase in recent years (from 1 article per year up to 39–40 articles by 2024–2025).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Field Maturation and Increased Emphasis:</strong><br>
The nearly universal absence of articles before the mid-2000s suggests that tourism research, at least as indexed in this dataset, was either in its infancy or not a priority at many institutions. The subsequent growth reflects:
<ul>
<li>A <strong>maturation of the field</strong> as tourism became an increasingly important economic, social, and environmental subject.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced institutional support</strong> and funding for tourism/hospitality research over time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exponential Growth in Recent Years:</strong><br>
The accelerated output from around 2018 onward for many affiliations (e.g., Hong Kong Polytechnic University, State University System of Florida) likely indicates:
<ul>
<li>A surge in research interest driven by global trends such as sustainability, digital transformation (e.g., virtual tourism), and the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on travel.</li>
<li>Greater collaboration and interdisciplinary approaches that boost publication output.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Regional Differences:</strong><br>
Institutions in regions with vibrant tourism industries (e.g., Florida, Hong Kong, Australia) exhibit particularly high growth rates. In contrast, some institutions with later entry into the field (e.g., Universidade do Algarve) show a delayed but rapid ramp-up, perhaps as the region’s tourism issues gained prominence.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>
<p>The data reveal that the production of tourism research has experienced a significant, mostly exponential increase over the past two decades. While many key affiliations showed little or no output in the early years, all have ramped up their production substantially, with especially dramatic increases observed from around 2018 onward.</p>
<p><strong>In summary,</strong> these trends underscore the growing academic and practical importance of tourism research worldwide. The consistent rise in article output across diverse institutions reflects both a maturing field and the increasing global relevance of tourism, sustainability, and hospitality studies.</p>

<p>The data presented offers a bibliometric analysis of psychological entitlement based on the country of the corresponding author. Here’s an interpretation and elaboration of the results:</p>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top Producers by Article Count:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>China</strong> leads with 304 articles (≈19.58% of total), followed by the <strong>USA</strong> with 261 articles (≈16.81%), and then the <strong>United Kingdom</strong> (116 articles, ≈7.47%) and <strong>Australia</strong> (107 articles, ≈6.89%).<br>
</li>
<li>Other notable contributors include <strong>Korea</strong> (80 articles), <strong>Spain</strong> (73), <strong>Portugal</strong> (53), <strong>India</strong> (48), <strong>Italy</strong> (36), and <strong>Canada</strong> (33).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Collaboration Patterns (SCP vs.&nbsp;MCP):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Country Publications (SCP)</strong> vs.&nbsp;<strong>Multiple Country Publications (MCP)</strong> provide insight into collaboration intensity. For example, China has 174 SCP and 130 MCP, meaning about 42.76% of its output is international collaboration.<br>
</li>
<li>The USA shows a lower international share at 33.72% (173 SCP vs.&nbsp;88 MCP).<br>
</li>
<li>In contrast, countries such as <strong>Korea</strong> (68.75% MCP) and <strong>Malaysia</strong> (68% MCP) have a high proportion of multi-country collaborations.</li>
<li>Some European countries (e.g., UK at 41.38%, Australia at 49.53%) show a balance between domestic and international outputs, whereas others (e.g., Spain at 26.03%, India at 14.58%) lean more toward domestic research.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volume and Influence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The top-producing countries (China, USA, UK, Australia) dominate overall production. Their high output may be driven by strong national research systems, significant tourism industries, and a high level of academic investment in tourism and hospitality studies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>International Collaboration Trends:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Higher MCP percentages in countries like Korea and Malaysia suggest that researchers there are highly engaged in cross-border collaborations. This can enrich research by bringing diverse perspectives and may reflect the strategic importance of global networks in rapidly evolving tourism contexts.</li>
<li>Lower MCP percentages for countries like India and Spain indicate that a larger share of their research is produced domestically. This might reflect either a strong local research community or less integration into international collaborative networks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Regional Dynamics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Many of the top-producing countries are from regions with vibrant tourism industries and strong governmental or institutional support for tourism research. The collaboration patterns can also hint at differences in research culture—some regions may prioritize international partnership while others focus on addressing local issues.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>
<p>These country-level data reveal that a few countries (China and the USA, in particular) produce a significant share of tourism research, while international collaboration levels vary considerably. Higher international collaboration percentages in countries like Korea and Malaysia suggest that global networks play a critical role in advancing their research, whereas other nations tend to produce more domestic work.</p>
<p><strong>In summary,</strong> the data underscore both the concentration of research output in a few major countries and the diverse collaboration strategies that reflect regional priorities and research cultures in the field of tourism and hospitality.</p>

<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Document Diversity</strong>:<br>
The table lists key documents in tourism research, identified by paper title, DOI, total citations, citations per year, and a normalized citation score. These documents span a range of publication years and include both seminal and more recent contributions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Citation Metrics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Citations (TC)</strong> vary widely—from documents with over 700 citations (e.g., <em>SHARPLEY R, 2014</em> with 704 TC) to those in the lower range (e.g., several papers with TC around 10–20).</li>
<li><strong>Citations per Year (TC per Year)</strong> show how frequently a paper is cited on an annual basis. Notably, some recent documents (e.g., <em>ZHENG DN, 2021</em> with 97.6 TC per Year) have very high annual citation rates, suggesting rapid recognition.</li>
<li><strong>Normalized TC</strong> adjusts citation counts for factors such as publication age, highlighting the relative impact. Here, values range significantly—for instance, <em>ZHENG DN, 2021</em> has a normalized TC of 16.27, whereas others are below 1, indicating that some papers are far more influential relative to their publication time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Journal Sources and Authorship</strong>:<br>
The documents are published in well-regarded journals (e.g., <em>Annals of Tourism Research, Journal of Travel Research, Tourism Management</em>) and represent contributions from prominent authors, reinforcing their status as key works in the field.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Seminal Contributions</strong>:<br>
Papers with very high total citations and normalized scores (e.g., <em>SHARPLEY R, 2014</em> and <em>ZHENG DN, 2021</em>) are likely to be seminal studies. Their high TC per Year values further suggest that these works have had a strong and sustained impact over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rapid Uptake of Recent Research</strong>:<br>
Some recent publications show impressive annual citation rates. For example, <em>ZHENG DN, 2021</em> achieves 97.6 citations per year, which, when normalized, indicates an exceptional influence compared to peers published in similar time frames.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relative Impact Variability</strong>:<br>
The wide range in normalized TC values reflects differences in how papers perform relative to the expected citation rate for their publication age. Documents with normalized TC values well above 1 are outperforming the typical citation benchmarks in tourism research.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Field Evolution</strong>:<br>
The mix of older, highly cited documents with more recent works that are rapidly accumulating citations illustrates the dynamic evolution of tourism research. It underscores that while foundational works continue to be referenced, innovative new studies are also making significant impacts.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="most-local-cited-documents">Most Local Cited Documents</h4>
<p>This section examines the most locally cited documents in our dataset. The table below provides key metrics for each document including: - <strong>Local Citations</strong>: Citations received within the local (disciplinary or community-specific) dataset. - <strong>Global Citations</strong>: Total citations received worldwide. - <strong>Ratio</strong>: The percentage of local citations relative to global citations. - <strong>Normalized Local/Global Citations</strong>: Citation counts that have been adjusted (typically by publication age) to allow fairer comparisons across documents.</p>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Citation Distribution</strong>
<ul>
<li>The documents show a wide variation in both local and global citations. For instance, <em>UYSAL M, 2016, TOURISM MANAGE</em> received 256 local and 554 global citations, whereas other papers in the lower part of the list have local citations as low as 1–2.</li>
<li>The <strong>Ratio</strong> (Local/Global × 100) ranges broadly. Some documents (e.g., <em>UYSAL M, 2016</em>) have a ratio near 46%, meaning nearly half of their citations come from the local community, while others (e.g., <em>SHARPLEY R, 2014</em>) have a lower ratio (~16%), indicating a greater share of citations coming from outside the local context.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Normalized Citation Metrics</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Normalized Local Citations</strong> vary from below 1 to over 14, and the <strong>Normalized Global Citations</strong> range similarly. These numbers adjust for factors like publication age so that more recent papers are compared fairly with older, more established works.</li>
<li>For example, <em>VADA S, 2020, TOUR MANAG PERSPECT</em> shows a high normalized local citation (13.43) compared to a normalized global citation of 3.89, suggesting a very strong local impact relative to its overall citation performance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Publication Year Spread</strong>
<ul>
<li>The sample spans from earlier publications (e.g., 2004) to recent works (projected up to 2025). Older documents tend to accumulate higher absolute citation counts, but normalization helps reveal their relative impact when accounting for the time available to be cited.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local vs.&nbsp;Global Impact</strong>
<ul>
<li>A high <strong>Local/Global Ratio</strong> implies that a document is especially influential within its local research community. For instance, <em>UYSAL M (2016)</em> with a ratio of 46.2% indicates that nearly half of its influence is local.</li>
<li>Conversely, documents with a lower ratio (e.g., <em>SHARPLEY R, 2014</em> at 16.3%) may have broader global appeal and are cited more by researchers outside the immediate field.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Normalized Citation Insights</strong>
<ul>
<li>The normalized metrics help in comparing documents of different ages. A high normalized local citation value (such as that for <em>VADA S, 2020</em>) highlights a paper that, despite being newer, has achieved substantial local recognition.</li>
<li>In some cases, normalized global citations remain high (e.g., <em>SHARPLEY R, 2014</em> and <em>KIM K, 2013</em>), indicating that these documents not only serve as core references in the local community but also enjoy widespread international attention.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Variability Across Documents</strong>
<ul>
<li>The variation in both absolute and normalized citation metrics suggests diversity in research impact. Some papers achieve a strong local resonance while others gain more global recognition.</li>
<li>The distribution also reflects disciplinary differences and possibly the evolving citation practices within the field over time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="references-spectroscopy">References Spectroscopy</h4>
<p>When we talk about “References Spectroscopy” in the context of bibliometrics, we are drawing an analogy with the spectroscopic techniques used in the physical sciences to analyze materials based on the spectrum of the radiation they emit or absorb.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reference Spectrum: Just as a material has a unique spectrum in physical spectroscopy, a research paper or topic will have a unique “spectrum” of references it cites. This spectrum can give insight into the foundational works for that paper or topic, indicating which previous works are most influential or relevant.</li>
<li>Analysis: By examining the “spectra” (or citation patterns) of multiple papers or topics, one can identify trends, clusters, and gaps in the research landscape. This is analogous to how one might use spectroscopy to categorize and analyze different materials based on their spectral signatures.</li>
<li>Evolution Over Time: Just as the spectrum of a star can tell us about its age and stage in the lifecycle, looking at the changing citation patterns or “spectra” over time can reveal how a field or topic has evolved. It can show which works have become foundational over time or which ones have fallen out of favor.</li>
<li>Intensity &amp; Peaks: In physical spectroscopy, the intensity of certain peaks in a spectrum can indicate the concentration of specific elements or compounds. Similarly, in bibliometrics, certain references might be cited much more frequently than others, indicating their centrality or importance to the field. These “peaks” in the citation spectrum can point to seminal works or pivotal authors in a domain.</li>
<li>Comparative Analysis: By comparing the “spectra” of different papers, topics, or even researchers, one can identify overlaps, synergies, and distinctions. This can be useful for interdisciplinary research, collaboration opportunities, or understanding the landscape of a broad field.</li>
<li>Anomalies &amp; Outliers: Sometimes, a spectrum will have unexpected peaks or features. In bibliometrics, unexpected citation patterns might indicate emerging areas of interest, interdisciplinary bridges, or even issues like citation cartels or excessive self-citation.</li>
<li>Application: Just as spectroscopy has practical applications in material identification, quality control, and more, bibliometric “spectroscopy” can be used for research evaluation, funding allocation, curriculum design, and other academic or research management tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, the concept of “References Spectroscopy” in bibliometrics is a metaphorical way of describing the deep analysis of citation patterns to understand the structure, evolution, and dynamics of scholarly research.</p>
<p>The “Reference publication year spectroscopy” (RPYS) is a method to analyze the age of cited references in a given publication set. It can reveal the seminal works and foundational literature within a topic or domain. Let’s break down and interpret the given data on the bibliometric analysis:</p>

</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foundational Works and Seminal Years:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The peaks in certain years represent “spectral signatures” of foundational works in the field. For example:
<ul>
<li><strong>1988 Peak (772 citations, diffMedian = 316):</strong> Suggests that seminal contributions published in 1988 have become critical reference points.</li>
<li><strong>Late 1990s to Early 2000s Peaks (1701–2151 citations):</strong> Indicate a period of high impact research that likely shaped current theories and methodologies.</li>
<li><strong>2010 and Beyond:</strong> The strong peak in 2010 (4595 citations) and subsequent increases through 2017 (6451 citations) highlight a modern wave of influential work.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Evolution Over Time:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The “spectrum” shows how the influential literature evolves:
<ul>
<li>Early periods (18th and 19th centuries) contribute sparsely.</li>
<li>Modern scholarship (late 20th century onward) provides a concentrated set of seminal works that dominate the citation landscape.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Intensity and Anomalies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The intensity (i.e., the height of the peaks) points to the centrality of key publications.<br>
</li>
<li>Abrupt declines in very recent years are less a sign of diminishing quality than a reflection of citation lag—newer articles have not yet had sufficient time to accumulate citations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Comparative and Trend Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>By comparing the citation “spectra” across time intervals, one can identify periods of rapid development or paradigm shifts in the field.</li>
<li>The data can also be used to spot potential anomalies or emerging trends when unusual peaks or valleys appear.</li>

</h4>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy provides a “spectral fingerprint” of a research field by mapping the age distribution of cited literature. The analysis reveals that certain years—often corresponding to seminal publications—dominate the citation landscape. Over time, these peaks mark periods of high impact and foundational contributions, while the recent decline reflects the natural citation lag for new works.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
- <strong>Data Pattern:</strong><br>
- A wide temporal range with a few distinct peaks that highlight seminal publication years. - Difference metrics (diffMedian5 and diffMedian) help accentuate these peaks relative to typical citation levels.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interpretation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>High citation peaks indicate the publication years of works that have become cornerstones of the field.</li>
<li>The evolution of the spectrum shows how foundational literature has accumulated over time, with recent years naturally showing lower counts due to citation lag.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Overall Insight:</strong>
<ul>
<li>RPYS is a powerful bibliometric tool that, by “spectroscoping” reference publication years, identifies the key historical contributions and tracks the evolution of scholarly influence within a discipline.</li>

<p>Bibliometric coupling occurs when two documents reference a common third document in their bibliographies. It’s a method used to understand and visualize the intellectual structure of a scientific field.</p>
<ul>
<li>Table1 Parameters:
<ul>
<li>Analysis of Documents using the CR (Cited References) field.</li>
<li>The analysis uses a single word (ngram = 1) as a term.</li>
<li>The labeling term used is ‘ID’.</li>
<li>The impact measure is local, meaning the citation scores are specific to this dataset and do not refer to global scores.</li>
<li>Stemming is set to false, which means words in their base form were not merged (e.g., ‘running’, ‘runner’, and ‘ran’ are treated as distinct words).</li>
<li>The size of 0.3 might refer to the size of the nodes or clusters in a visualization (if one exists).</li>
<li>Community repulsion and repel are both set to zero or false, which means there is no repulsion force in the clustering process. This could have implications for the layout of a network visualization.</li>
<li>Walktrap is the clustering method used. Walktrap is a method that identifies communities (or clusters) in networks by simulating random walks.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>These parameters tell us that the bibliocoupling analysis focused on a set of 250 documents. Only references cited at least 7 times were considered, and the local citation impact was used to weigh the coupling. The walktrap clustering algorithm was chosen to detect communities (clusters) among documents.</p></li>
<li><p>All the documents in Table 2 are assigned to Cluster 1, indicating that—under the chosen coupling criteria—they share a similar citation footprint. The NormalizedLocalCitationScore gives an idea of each document’s local impact within this cluster. Higher scores (for example, above 5) may indicate that these works are central in this group, while lower scores indicate a more peripheral position.</p></li>
<li><p>The labels are created by extracting key words that most frequently appear within the coupled documents. For instance, in Cluster 1 the dominant topics appear to be “quality-of-life,” “satisfaction,” and “perceptions.” The “conf” values (for “confidence”) indicate the proportion with which these words characterize the cluster. In Cluster 2, terms such as “satisfaction,” “tourism,” and “happiness” define the group. The frequency (number of documents or occurrences), centrality (how central this cluster is within the network), and impact (aggregate local impact) help to compare the importance of each cluster. The color codes can be used to visually distinguish clusters in network visualizations.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cluster Formation:
<ul>
<li>The bibliocoupling analysis shows that a large portion of the 250 documents (as seen in Table 2) belong to a single dominant cluster (Cluster 1), suggesting a high degree of shared references among these works. The cluster is characterized by themes related to quality-of-life, satisfaction, and perceptions—a reflection of a common intellectual basis in tourism and hospitality research.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cluster Labels and Themes:
<ul>
<li>Table 3 provides a “spectral” overview of clusters by summarizing the key themes. Different clusters (here, four groups are shown) have distinctive profiles:</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Groups
<ul>
<li>Group 1: Emphasizes quality-of-life, satisfaction, and perceptions.</li>
<li>Group 2: Highlights satisfaction, tourism, and happiness.</li>
<li>Group 3: Focuses on tourism as well as quality-of-life and satisfaction (but with a different balance).</li>
<li>Group 4: Indicates a blend where quality-of-life and happiness are important alongside satisfaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Application: Such an analysis can help researchers identify the intellectual foundations of the field, pinpoint seminal works, and recognize the evolution of research topics over time. It also facilitates the discovery of potential gaps, emerging clusters, or the need for interdisciplinary bridges.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>
<p>In summary, this bibliocoupling analysis—through document clustering—provides a detailed “map” of how research in tourism, quality-of-life, satisfaction, and related fields is interconnected. The parameters (Table 1) set the stage for the analysis, Table 2 shows the membership and impact of individual works within a cluster, and Table 3 synthesizes the thematic essence of each cluster, offering insights into the structure and evolution of the research landscape.</p>

<p>Based on the provided data, it appears to be a bibliometric analysis of the term. Bibliometric analysis is used to quantify and analyze published literature on a particular topic, often to identify the most prevalent themes, authors, and journals. The data seems to be organized in a thematic map, detailing the occurrences and relevance of certain words or terms associated with the topic.</p>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<p>The Thematic Map positions each cluster according to two metrics:</p>
<p>Callon Centrality: How important or “central” a cluster is to the entire research domain. High centrality indicates the cluster is well-connected and influences many other themes. Callon Density: How internally cohesive or “dense” a cluster is. High density indicates the cluster’s themes are well-developed and strongly interconnected. Additionally, the bubble size corresponds to the frequency of topics within that cluster (i.e., how often these topics appear in the dataset).</p>

<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Health</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Density (13.25): Indicates a well-developed, cohesive set of themes.</li>
<li>Centrality (2.91): The cluster is moderately influential within the overall research landscape.</li>
<li>Frequency (1932): There is a substantial volume of research, covering:
<ul>
<li>Well-being, mental health, stress, physical activity, wellness tourism, and vacation benefits.</li>
<li>Topics such as positive psychology, life satisfaction, stress, self-determination, and burnout frequently appear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpretation: Although not the most central cluster, “Health” is deeply explored and internally cohesive. It serves as a significant subfield, possibly appealing to scholars studying tourism’s role in stress reduction, wellness experiences, and overall well-being.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Satisfaction</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Density (10.38): Well-developed but not as dense as “Health.”</li>
<li>Centrality (5.24): The highest among all clusters, indicating it is a key bridging concept for the entire domain.</li>
<li>Frequency (3244): The largest volume of research. Core themes include:
<ul>
<li>Consumer behavior, service quality, tourism experience, loyalty, behavioral intentions, motivation, and hospitality management.</li>
<li>The presence of strong “experience” and “modeling” keywords indicates robust quantitative and conceptual frameworks analyzing satisfaction-related outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpretation: “Satisfaction” is pivotal to the domain. It connects to many other themes (e.g., loyalty, experience, perceived value), making it a central hub in tourism and hospitality research.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Perceptions</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Density (10.76): Similar to “Satisfaction” in density, indicating strong internal links.</li>
<li>Centrality (1.99): Somewhat lower centrality compared to “Satisfaction,” but not marginal.</li>
<li>Frequency (1461): Moderately sized. Key themes:
<ul>
<li>Attitudes, community perceptions, residents’ support, sustainable tourism, social impacts, and management aspects.</li>
<li>Emphasis on how locals, communities, and stakeholders perceive tourism’s impacts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpretation: “Perceptions” focuses on stakeholder attitudes (especially residents), community-level impacts, and sustainability. Its moderate centrality suggests it is more specialized than “Satisfaction” but remains an important dimension of tourism research.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Quality-of-Life</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Density (9.51): The lowest density, indicating it is less internally cohesive compared to the others.</li>
<li>Centrality (1.78): Also relatively low, meaning it is less connected to other clusters.</li>
<li>Frequency (866): The smallest cluster, yet thematically crucial. Key topics:
<ul>
<li>Socio-economic impacts, well-being research, policy aspects, urban tourism, and city contexts.</li>
<li>Terms like “heritage,” “choice,” “innovation,” and “rural tourism” appear, suggesting a broad range but less internal overlap.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpretation: “Quality-of-Life” is foundational to tourism’s broader socio-economic discourse, linking well-being to policy and development. Despite lower centrality and density, it remains a conceptually important area, especially for strategic and policy-driven studies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Health (high density, moderate centrality): A strongly developed cluster focusing on well-being, mental health, stress, and physical activity in tourism contexts.</li>
<li>Satisfaction (highest centrality, well-developed density): The dominant cluster bridging various subfields in tourism and hospitality—centered on consumer satisfaction, loyalty, and experience.</li>
<li>Perceptions (moderate centrality, moderate-high density): Focused on stakeholder attitudes, community impacts, and sustainability. Emphasizes how local communities and other stakeholders perceive tourism’s effects.</li>
<li>Quality-of-Life (lowest centrality and density, smaller size): Addresses broader socio-economic outcomes, well-being research, and policy concerns, providing a more macro-level perspective on how tourism influences overall life quality.</li>
<li>The Satisfaction cluster emerges as the most central—meaning it touches many other areas of tourism research—while Health is the most internally cohesive (highest density). Perceptions occupies a mid-range position, suggesting it is well-studied but less of a “bridge” than Satisfaction. Quality-of-Life appears more specialized, with fewer interconnections but important for strategic policy insights.</li>
<li>The thematic analysis reveals four major research clusters in the field: Health, Satisfaction, Perceptions, and Quality-of-Life.</li>
<li>Satisfaction is the key bridging concept in tourism and hospitality studies, connecting with consumer behavior, loyalty, service quality, and experience-driven research.</li>
<li>Health is a well-established, highly cohesive cluster focusing on wellness and well-being, indicating a strong niche of scholarship.</li>
<li>Perceptions revolve around how stakeholders and communities view tourism, highlighting attitudes, community support, and sustainable tourism.</li>
<li>Quality-of-Life stands out for exploring policy, socio-economic, and macro-level impacts, though it is less interconnected with other clusters.</li>
<li>Overall, these four clusters collectively structure the tourism and hospitality research landscape, reflecting both micro-level topics (e.g., satisfaction, well-being) and macro-level considerations (e.g., community perceptions, quality-of-life, policy). Future research may benefit from integrating these clusters, for instance, examining how quality-of-life outcomes tie into satisfaction drivers, or how community perceptions intersect with health-related tourism experiences.</li>

<section id="factorial-analysis" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="factorial-analysis">Factorial Analysis</h4>
<p>Factorial analysis is a statistical method used to identify the underlying relationships among a set of variables. Here, you’ve presented data for words (probably representing research themes or keywords) and documents (probably representing research papers) in two different dimensions (Dim.1 and Dim.2).</p>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>In our dataset, 50+ keywords (e.g., “quality.of.life”, “satisfaction”, “tourism”, “happiness”, “perceptions”, etc.) were subjected to a factor analysis. Two factors (here labeled Dim1 and Dim2) emerged that account for a major part of the variance in the keywords’ co-occurrence patterns. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality.of.life shows a strong negative loading on Dim1 (–0.85) and near zero on Dim2.</li>
<li>Attitudes and perceptions both load very negatively on Dim1 (–1.63 and –1.15, respectively), while other terms such as support (–1.86) and sustainable.tourism (–1.87) are also strongly negative on Dim1.</li>
<li>In contrast, words such as vacation (1.05 on Dim1 and 1.16 on Dim2), health (0.81, 0.87), leisure (0.81, 0.97) and life (0.96, 0.17) show strong positive values—especially on Dim1.</li>
<li>Some terms are more prominent on Dim2: for example, happiness (0.47, 0.58) and experiences (0.5, 0.69) suggest an important emotional/experiential component.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Each keyword’s coordinates on these two dimensions is thought to reflect underlying “latent” factors in how topics are discussed in the literature.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<p>Although interpretation in factor analysis can be somewhat subjective, the pattern of loadings suggests the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dimension 1: “Value &amp; Appraisal versus Critical/Contextual Factors”
<ul>
<li>High positive loadings (e.g., “vacation,” “life,” “health,” “leisure”) indicate terms that are typically associated with positive experiential outcomes and well‐being.</li>
<li>High negative loadings (e.g., “perceptions,” “attitudes,” “support,” “sustainable.tourism”) indicate concepts that may capture evaluative or critical aspects (for example, community or stakeholder concerns, or constructs that question the status quo).</li>
<li>In essence, Dim1 appears to differentiate research that emphasizes the positive, beneficial, or “value‐adding” aspects of tourism from work that focuses on critical or challenging perspectives (or even on the underlying cognitive–affective appraisals of tourism impacts).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dimension 2: “Emotional-Experiential Intensity versus Structural/Process Aspects”
<ul>
<li>Higher scores on Dim2 (e.g., “happiness,” “experiences,” “leisure,” “benefits”) suggest a focus on the intensity of affect, emotion, or subjective experience.</li>
<li>In contrast, keywords such as “model,” “service.quality,” “behavioral.intentions,” and “loyalty”—which load more strongly in the negative direction on Dim2—may be more concerned with evaluative, outcome‐oriented, or structural aspects of tourism research.</li>
<li>Thus, Dim2 can be seen as contrasting research that emphasizes the affective, emotional, and experiential side of tourism versus work that is more about measurement models, process evaluations, and outcome indicators.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Two key dimensions emerged from the factor analysis on tourism–related keywords.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dimension 1 appears to capture a continuum from positive experiential and well–being aspects (e.g., “vacation,” “health,” “leisure,” “life”) to more evaluative or critical constructs (e.g., “attitudes,” “perceptions,” “support,” “sustainable.tourism”).</li>
<li>Dimension 2 seems to distinguish between emotionally charged, experiential concepts (e.g., “happiness,” “experiences”) and those keywords that are more process‐ or model–oriented (e.g., “model,” “behavioral.intentions,” “service.quality”).</li>
<li>All keywords included in this analysis were part of a single cluster (Cluster 1), indicating that while there is one overall thematic grouping in the literature, two latent dimensions underlie how these themes interrelate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>The factor analysis reveals that within tourism research the scholarly discourse can be understood along two interrelated axes. One axis (Dim1) differentiates between constructs related to positive outcomes and quality of life versus those that reflect critical perceptions and contextual challenges. The other axis (Dim2) highlights the distinction between the intensity of emotional and experiential aspects and more structural, model-based, or outcome–focused measures.</li>
<li>This dual‐dimensional structure underscores the multifaceted nature of tourism research. Researchers and practitioners can use these insights to:
<ul>
<li>Better understand which concepts are central to different research traditions (e.g., studies of well–being versus evaluations of tourism impacts).</li>
<li>Guide future investigations by clarifying which aspects (emotional vs.&nbsp;structural, positive vs.&nbsp;critical) remain underexplored or in need of deeper theoretical integration.</li>
<li>Inform policy and management decisions by recognizing that both subjective well–being and structural performance indicators are critical in evaluating the success and sustainability of tourism initiatives.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the latent dimensions identified through the factor analysis provide a nuanced picture of how keywords cluster around themes of quality-of-life and satisfaction, while also highlighting the role of emotional experience versus evaluative modeling in tourism research. This enhanced understanding can help orient future research and interdisciplinary dialogue within the field.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="co-citation-network">Co-citation Network</h3>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<p>Network Structure and Clusters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cluster 1: This group includes documents such as Mccabe et al.&nbsp;(2013), Gilbert (2004), Smith (2017), Sirgy (2011), and several others. These works generally have moderate to low betweenness values (e.g., betweenness ranging from about 0.3 to 8) and closeness values around 0.012–0.015. Their PageRank scores (ranging roughly from 0.01 to 0.03) indicate that while they are cited together and contribute to a cohesive group, they are not the highest “bridging” documents in the network.</p></li>
<li><p>Cluster 2: Starting with nodes such as Kim K (2013), Andereck KL (2011), Woo E (2015), and others, Cluster 2 documents show very high betweenness values (e.g., 14–15 and even up to 27 in some cases) and relatively high closeness (around 0.014–0.017). Their PageRank scores (up to 0.036) indicate that these documents play a key role in linking various subfields or subtopics. This cluster likely represents a group of seminal or central works that many later studies reference together.</p></li>
<li><p>Cluster 3: The third cluster (which begins with Fornell (1981) and includes Uysal (2016), Hair (2010), Podsakoff (2003), etc.) has very high betweenness values (for instance, Fornell’s betweenness is over 130) and higher closeness values (around 0.017–0.019). Their PageRank scores are also higher (up to 0.03 or more). This cluster appears to capture highly influential and broadly recognized works that serve as intellectual hubs in the tourism literature.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Centrality Measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Betweenness Centrality: This measure reflects how often a document lies on the shortest path between other documents. Documents with high betweenness (e.g., those in Cluster 3) are considered “bridges” between different parts of the network, indicating they are crucial for connecting diverse research streams.</li>
<li>Closeness Centrality: This value shows how close a document is to all other documents in the network. Most documents have closeness values in the narrow range (~0.012–0.019), suggesting that while there are differences, the network is relatively compact.</li>
<li>PageRank: Higher PageRank values (e.g., those for some Cluster 3 documents) indicate that those papers are not only well‐cited but also cited by other well‐cited documents, underlining their broader influence within the literature.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Distinct Intellectual Communities: The emergence of three clusters indicates that the field of tourism research is divided into at least three distinct intellectual communities or subfields. Each cluster groups together articles that tend to be cited together, suggesting that they share common themes or theoretical frameworks.</p></li>
<li><p>Influence and Bridging Roles: Documents in Cluster 3 (with very high betweenness and PageRank) appear to serve as key bridges, likely representing foundational or methodological works that have influenced multiple strands of tourism research. In contrast, Cluster 1 documents may be more specialized or represent a more coherent niche, while Cluster 2 contains influential works that are central to connecting topics within that niche.</p></li>
<li><p>Role of Seminal Works: For instance, Fornell’s (1981) work in Cluster 3 has an exceptionally high betweenness centrality, marking it as a pivotal reference that links diverse research areas. Similarly, high betweenness scores in Cluster 2 (e.g., for Kim K (2013) and Andereck KL (2011)) suggest that these studies have had a substantial impact on subsequent research and are frequently co‐cited with a wide range of other documents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>
<p>The co‐citation network analysis reveals a structured landscape in tourism research where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster 1 comprises documents that form a specialized but cohesive group with moderate centrality values.</li>
<li>Cluster 2 consists of influential works that serve as important connectors within a subfield, having high betweenness and relatively high PageRank scores.</li>
<li>Cluster 3 includes seminal and widely influential documents that act as intellectual hubs, connecting diverse research streams across the field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: The network structure underscores the multidimensional nature of tourism research. High-centrality documents—particularly those in Cluster 3—are key for bridging theoretical, methodological, and empirical studies, thereby facilitating cross-fertilization between different research areas. In contrast, Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 represent more thematically coherent or specialized sub-communities. Recognizing these clusters and the roles of the central documents can guide researchers in identifying core literature, understanding the evolution of the field, and pinpointing potential areas for future interdisciplinary integration. This co‐citation analysis ultimately highlights both the diversity and the interconnectedness of scholarly work in tourism research.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Co-Citation Network In the co‑citation network, individual documents are represented as nodes and the frequency with which they are cited together forms the links between them. Key metrics—betweenness, closeness, and PageRank—help us gauge the influence and connectivity of each publication.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Clusters and Influential Works:
<ul>
<li>The network reveals several distinct clusters (in our sample, clusters “1”, “2”, and “3”) that represent different intellectual sub-communities within the literature. For example, documents such as Fornell (1981), Uysal (2016), and Hair (2010) in Cluster 3 have exceptionally high betweenness and PageRank scores. These works are central bridging documents that are not only well cited themselves but also frequently cited together with other influential studies. Their high betweenness indicates that they connect diverse parts of the network, suggesting that they serve as foundational references that have shaped multiple strands of research.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Centrality Measures:
<ul>
<li>Betweenness Centrality shows the role of a document as an intermediary between other works. Higher values (as seen with Fornell and Uysal) imply that these papers act as important conduits through which ideas and methods disseminate. Closeness Centrality indicates how near a document is to all others in the network, with most values clustering in a narrow band. This implies that, while differences exist, the network is relatively compact.</li>
<li>PageRank reflects the overall “prestige” or influence of a paper. Documents with higher PageRank, particularly in Cluster 3, are influential in the sense that they are cited by other highly cited works.</li>
<li>Overall, the co‑citation analysis suggests that seminal publications serve as intellectual hubs. They not only anchor their respective subfields but also bridge across them, facilitating the diffusion of ideas in the broader domain of tourism, quality of life, and well‑being research.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Factorial Analysis on Keywords The factorial analysis on keywords investigates the underlying dimensions that organize the intellectual content of the field. In the provided table:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Dimensions (Factors):
<ul>
<li>The keywords have been projected onto two dimensions (Dim1 and Dim2) that capture patterns of co‑occurrence and semantic similarity across the literature. For instance:</li>
<li>Keywords such as “quality.of.life”, “perceptions”, “attitudes”, “support”, “impacts” show strong negative loadings on the first dimension. This grouping may represent a critical or evaluative dimension in which the literature focuses on the challenges or complexities of assessing quality of life and subjective well‑being.</li>
<li>In contrast, keywords such as “happiness”, “health”, “experiences”, “leisure”, “benefits”, “vacation”, and “positive.psychology” tend to have positive loadings on the first and second dimensions. This pattern suggests a complementary perspective emphasizing the positive and experiential aspects of tourism and its contribution to well‑being.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Thematic Grouping:
<ul>
<li>The factorial solution appears to cluster together terms that reflect both the evaluative (e.g., perceptions, attitudes, and negative aspects like stress or constraints) and the experiential (e.g., happiness, health, leisure, and benefits) sides of the literature. This dual structure underscores the multidimensionality of research in tourism: while some works scrutinize the challenges and potential negative impacts (or the critical evaluation of quality-of-life metrics), others highlight the positive outcomes and benefits that travel and leisure experiences can offer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Document Contributions:
<ul>
<li>A complementary analysis of documents (Table 2) shows how individual papers load on these dimensions. Papers with strong positive contributions might represent research that emphasizes the uplifting and beneficial outcomes of travel experiences, whereas those with negative loadings may address challenges, limitations, or areas for improvement in assessing tourism’s impact on quality of life.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Conclusion &amp; Summary</strong>
</h4>
<p>The combined analyses reveal a rich, interconnected intellectual landscape in tourism and well‑being research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co‑citation Network:
<ul>
<li>The network structure, through its clusters and centrality measures, indicates that the field is anchored by several seminal works—especially in Cluster 3—that serve as critical hubs linking diverse research streams. These influential documents act as bridges, disseminating ideas across the field and underpinning both methodological and conceptual advances. Meanwhile, other clusters represent more specialized thematic groups that address specific aspects of tourism’s impact on quality of life.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Factorial Analysis on Keywords:
<ul>
<li>The keyword analysis uncovers two main dimensions that represent opposing yet complementary perspectives. One dimension is characterized by critical evaluative terms (such as negative perceptions, stress, or constraints) while the other highlights the positive, experiential outcomes (including happiness, health, leisure, and benefits). This duality reflects the inherent complexity of tourism research, where studies balance assessments of both the challenges and the enriching aspects of travel experiences.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Conclusion:
<ul>
<li>Taken together, these analyses demonstrate that tourism research is multifaceted—both in its intellectual structure and in its thematic content. The co‑citation network identifies key publications that have significantly influenced the field and act as linchpins connecting various research areas. Simultaneously, the factorial analysis of keywords reveals a nuanced interplay between critical evaluation and the celebration of positive experiences. Recognizing these patterns can help researchers, practitioners, and policymakers better understand the evolution of the field, identify core literature and emerging trends, and foster further interdisciplinary integration. This comprehensive insight supports more informed decisions in research direction, policy formulation, and the practical application of tourism and well‑being studies.</li>

<p>The given data presents a bibliometric analysis of the author collaboration network on the topic. The metrics included are betweenness, closeness, and PageRank. Let’s delve into an interpretation of the results:</p>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Description</strong>
</h4>
<p>The collaboration network represents how authors are connected through co‑authorship relationships. Each node is an individual researcher, and the network is partitioned into several clusters (labeled here by numbers). In this dataset, nodes are characterized by several centrality measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Betweenness Centrality: Indicates an author’s role as a “bridge” or connector between otherwise separate parts of the network. High betweenness suggests that an author plays a key role in linking different collaboration groups.</li>
<li>Closeness Centrality: Reflects how “close” an author is to all other authors in the network. A higher closeness value means that the author is well‑positioned to quickly interact or share information with others.</li>
<li>PageRank: Captures the overall “influence” or prestige of the author within the network, taking into account not only the number but also the importance of collaborators.</li>
</ul>
<p>The network is divided into several clusters (e.g., Cluster 1, Cluster 2, Cluster 3, etc.), suggesting that researchers tend to collaborate within certain groups. For example, Cluster 1 includes nodes like Zhang Y, Gao J, Lee TJ, and Chen CC, while Cluster 2 is characterized by authors such as Kim S, Lee CK, Han H, and Ramkissoon H.</p>
<h4 class="anchored">
<strong>Interpretation</strong>
</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Key Connectors and Influencers:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Zhang Y (Cluster 1) shows the highest betweenness in its cluster (≈72.67), which means that this author often serves as a bridge between otherwise disconnected groups. In addition, a high PageRank (≈0.0346) further underscores Zhang Y’s influential position.</li>
<li>In Cluster 2, authors like Kim S, Lee CK, Han H, and Ramkissoon H also have high betweenness values and relatively high closeness scores, indicating that this group is not only tightly knit but also well connected to other parts of the network.</li>
<li>Uysal M in Cluster 10 stands out with a high betweenness of about 74.31 and an impressive PageRank of nearly 0.06, suggesting that Uysal is a central figure in a distinct collaboration sub‑community, acting as both a hub and a bridge to other groups.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion-of-the-bibliometrics">Discussion of the bibliometrics</h2>
<p>The analysis report (Chae, 2025a) offers a comprehensive bibliometric examination of the literature on tourists’ experiences and happiness. It employs performance indicators, co-citation analyses, and thematic mappings to reveal publication trends, identify influential authors and journals, and elucidate the conceptual and intellectual structures that define this research domain. Overall, it shows an initial, gradual increase in publications in the early 2000s, followed by a sharp rise in recent years, signaling widespread scholarly and societal interest in how tourism intersects with well-being. Older publications consistently demonstrate higher citation counts, reflecting their foundational impact. Key journals such as Tourism Management, Journal of Travel Research, and Journal of Sustainable Tourism play a central role in disseminating significant findings, while researchers like Uysal, Filep, and Kim appear repeatedly as leading figures, suggesting a concentration of expertise and influence. The analysis also highlights extensive international collaboration—spanning China, the United States, and Australia—underscoring the global scope of tourism research and the multifaceted ways it addresses quality of life, subjective well-being, and holistic travel experiences. Two principal thematic clusters emerge. One focuses on macro-level constructs such as quality of life, community impacts, and satisfaction, while the other centers on micro-level, traveler-centric themes such as health, happiness, and experiential outcomes. Factor analysis adds nuance to these findings, indicating that hedonic (pleasure-oriented) and eudaimonic (meaning-oriented) perspectives both occupy prominent positions in scholarly discussions of tourist well-being.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Relevant Arguments Findings shows emphasizing the need to move beyond tourism’s economic or recreational aspects and to integrate subjective well-being and life satisfaction into the scholarly lens. The proposal advocates a holistic, interdisciplinary framework that brings together psychology, economics, sociology, and management to study hedonic and eudaimonic aspects. Similarly, the analysis report indicates that tourism studies are increasingly investigating subjective constructs such as quality of life, satisfaction, and happiness, although these efforts sometimes remain fragmented and isolated. Both sources suggest that comprehensive research on tourism and happiness has the potential to shape more robust policies, industry practices, and cross-disciplinary collaborations that can improve overall quality of life for travelers and host communities.</p></li>
<li><p>Research Questions and Finidngs</p>
<ul>
<li><p>RQ1: Do Tourism Experiences Enhance Subjective Well-Being? The proposal posits that tourism positively influences subjective well-being, asserting that travel boosts happiness and life satisfaction. The analysis report (Chae, 2025a) confirms that many studies document heightened happiness around trips, a phenomenon sometimes termed the “vacation effect.” It does, however, highlight that this uplift may be short-lived, with happiness levels eventually reverting to baseline. Nonetheless, it also notes that certain meaningful or “eudaimonic” travel experiences can create deeper and longer-lasting gains. These findings validate the proposal’s fundamental assumption about a positive tourism–happiness link but also stress that duration and intensity of the benefit depend on how and why people travel.</p></li>
<li><p>RQ2: Which Factors in Tourism Experiences Most Influence Happiness? The proposal underscores factors like destination quality, enjoyment, and safety as primary drivers of tourist happiness. In alignment with this view, the bibliometric analysis pinpoints environmental quality, destination image, risk perception, and authenticity of the travel experience as central to well-being (Chae, 2025a). Overcrowding is identified as a negative influence, especially under conditions of overtourism. In addition, the discussion of safety—particularly in light of global health events—underscores the importance of contextual variables. These observations reinforce the proposal’s argument while broadening its scope: beyond mere enjoyment or good service, factors like social environment and health-related safeguards are indispensable for ensuring a truly satisfying trip.</p></li>
<li><p>RQ3: How Do Scholars Conceptualize and Measure Tourist Happiness? The proposal suggests a positive-psychology framework incorporating both hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions. The analysis report (Chae, 2025a) shows that the field largely adopts Diener’s (1984) Subjective Well-Being constructs, blending positive affect, negative affect, and cognitive life satisfaction. Measures such as the Life Satisfaction Scale frequently appear, reflecting a primarily subjective, survey-based methodology. Many researchers also explore deeper, purpose-driven experiences, thus affirming the proposal’s view that happiness is more than a fleeting emotion; rather, it can involve personal growth and meaning. These findings confirm that tourism scholars prioritize psychological scales and models of well-being, lending empirical support to the proposal’s approach.</p></li>
<li><p>RQ4: What Are the Major Research Gaps and Future Directions? The proposal argues that tourism-happiness research remains fragmented and requires interdisciplinary integration. The bibliometric analysis confirms this fragmentation while identifying trends such as sustainability, technology-driven experiences, and global risk factors (Chae, 2025a). Sustainability issues appear increasingly central, as do the psychological and behavioral effects of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging questions also concern digital tourism and how online platforms can shape or mediate tourist well-being. These gaps and emerging foci echo the proposal’s call for an integrative framework that spans economics, sociology, public health, and psychology. The analysis thereby extends the proposal’s recommendations by highlighting specific under-studied domains—particularly the long-term psychological consequences of travel disruptions and the evolving influence of virtual reality on tourist experiences.</p></li>

Together, they build a case for a more holistic understanding of tourism’s multifaceted impact on human well-being. This perspective is essential as it calls for integrating both psychological and socio-economic dimensions to inform policy, practice, and further academic inquiry.</h4>

One of the main challenges is operationalizing subjective constructs like happiness and well-being in a standardized and comparable way. On the innovation front, the proposal advocates for a combination of bibliometric methods, qualitative content analysis, and machine-learning techniques (such as structural topic modeling) to map research trends and uncover latent intellectual structures. The analysis report further demonstrates how network analyses (co-citation, bibliographic coupling) and factorial analyses can reveal the underpinnings of tourism research. These methodological innovations not only help in capturing complex interrelations but also pave the way for more robust, data-driven evaluations of how tourism contributes to happiness.</h4>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion-of-the-bibliometrics-analysis">Conclusion of the bibliometrics analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>The bibliometric analysis report and the research proposal collectively illuminate a maturing yet still evolving scholarly landscape. A core consensus emerges that tourism experiences do, in fact, enhance happiness, albeit through varying degrees of hedonic and eudaimonic pathways. The field’s conceptual and methodological foundations rest upon well-established positive-psychology measures, although new lines of inquiry—such as sustainability, risk perception, and digital transformation—point to a broader, interdisciplinary perspective. Both documents underscore the importance of situating tourism within a more holistic, life-satisfaction context that accounts for cultural, social, and psychological complexities. The analysis confirms the proposal’s argument that tourism research now recognizes human well-being as a crucial outcome of travel experiences, but it also reveals areas where research remains patchy, calling for innovative, data-driven methods and collaborative theoretical models. By uniting insights from the proposal’s theoretical roadmap with the analysis report’s empirical mapping, scholars and practitioners can more effectively harness tourism’s potential to foster and sustain human happiness in a rapidly changing global environment.</li>
<li>In conclusion, findings converge on the need for a comprehensive, integrative approach to studying the relationship between tourism and happiness. The relevant arguments call for moving beyond narrow, isolated studies toward a multidimensional framework that accounts for both immediate and lasting impacts on well-being. Future research should address the proposed questions, embrace interdisciplinary methodologies, and overcome challenges related to data standardization and integration. Together, these efforts can deepen our understanding of tourism’s transformative potential for enhancing quality of life, guiding both academic research and practical interventions in the tourism industry. <!--새페이지--></li>
