    "text": "Overview\n\nMain Information\ngt::gt(MainInfo)\n\nDescription\n\n\nTimespan and Growth:\n\nThe dataset spans from 1992 to 2025 with an annual growth rate of 12.59%.\n\nThere are 1553 documents contributing to this dataset.\n\nDocument Metrics:\n\nAverage citations per document is 30.05, indicating a relatively high citation impact.\n\nDocument Average Age is 4.37 years, suggesting many publications are relatively recent.\n\nA total of 70,323 references were cited across all documents.\n\nKeywords:\n\nKeywords Plus (ID) total 2269, while Author’s Keywords (DE) total 4512.\n\nThis indicates a broad range of topical coverage and suggests authors employ a wide variety of terms to describe their work.\n\nAuthors and Collaboration:\n\nThere are 3258 authors in total. Of these, 146 are authors of single-authored documents, and there are 160 single-authored documents.\n\nThe average Co-Authors per Document is 3.02, showing moderate teamwork on publications.\n\n39.73% of the documents involve international co-authorship, highlighting a significant level of global collaboration.\n\nDocument Types:\n\nThe majority are articles (1359), followed by:\n\narticle; early access: 124\n\nreview: 60\n\nreview; early access: 6\n\nSmaller numbers for proceedings papers, editorial material, and one retracted publication.\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe robust annual growth rate (12.59%) from 1992 to 2025 reflects an expanding research area, with increasing numbers of publications.\n\nThe relatively young average age (4.37 years) of the documents implies that the field is actively publishing new studies or is experiencing a surge of recent interest.\n\nA high average citation rate (30.05) points to the significance or influence of these studies, indicating that the research outputs are resonating within the scholarly community.\n\nThe large number of references (70,323) suggests that authors are building upon extensive prior knowledge, indicative of a well-established research base.\n\nCollaboration metrics:\n\nAn average of 3.02 co-authors per document indicates moderate teamwork among researchers.\n\n39.73% international co-authorship underscores a noteworthy global dimension to this research area, suggesting both the relevance and collaborative nature of the topic.\n\n\nThe predominance of articles shows that the main mode of dissemination is through empirical or theoretical research papers, while the presence of reviews (66 in total) indicates ongoing efforts to synthesize existing knowledge.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nOverall, these findings reveal a dynamically growing field with a steady increase in publications over the past few decades. High citation averages and a diverse, global collaborative network underscore the field’s academic importance. The dominance of articles among document types and the variety in keywords highlight broad research engagement and topical exploration.\nIn summary, the field demonstrates strong growth, collaborative spirit, and robust impact in terms of citation—signaling a vibrant and evolving scholarly community.\n\n\nAnnual Scientific Production\n\nDescription\n\n\nGradual Emergence (1992–2005):\nThe number of articles is very low in the early years, ranging from 0 to 2 per year, with a small uptick to 5 in 2006.\nSteady Uptick (2006–2015):\nFrom 2006 onward, there is a gradual climb in publications:\n\n5 articles in 2006\n\n10 articles by 2010\n\n29 articles by 2015\n\nSignificant Surge (2016–2024):\nThe publication count shows a substantial rise during this period:\n\n53 articles in 2016\n\n98 in 2019\n\n142 in 2020\n\n191 in 2022\n\n342 in 2024\n\nPartial Data or Drop in 2025:\nAfter a record high in 2024 (342 articles), the count is 50 in 2025, which might indicate data for 2025 is incomplete or still being collected.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nGrowing Research Interest:\nThe rise from single-digit publications in the early 2000s to over 300 in 2024 highlights increasing global interest and research efforts in this field or topic.\nAccelerating Publication Rate:\nThe jump from 2015 to 2024 suggests not just incremental growth but an accelerating pace of output, possibly due to:\n\nIncreased funding or recognition of the field’s importance\n\nMore collaborative networks and open-access channels\n\nOngoing technological or theoretical breakthroughs leading to higher publication productivity\n\nFluctuation in Latest Year (2025):\nThe sharp decline to 50 articles in 2025 likely reflects partial data for the year. If the pattern holds, the final count for 2025 may approach or exceed previous totals once data collection is complete.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nIn summary, the annual scientific production has shown a marked upward trajectory over the past decades, reflecting growing engagement and collaboration in this research area. The lower 2025 figure is likely due to incomplete data rather than a genuine downturn. Overall, the trend underscores a maturing field with increasing scholarly attention and output.\ngt::gt(AnnualSciProd)\n(data/figure/AnnualSciProd.png)\n\n\nAverage Citations per Year\n\nDescription\n\n\nMean Total Citations per Article (MeanTCperArt):\n\nHigher values appear in earlier years (e.g., 178 in 1996, 195 in 2004), while more recent years show much lower values (e.g., 3.13 in 2024, 1.44 in 2025).\n\nThis reflects the longer timespan older articles have had to accumulate citations.\n\nNumber of Articles (N):\n\nSparse in the early years (often 1 or 2 articles).\n\nSubstantial increase in later years, with 342 articles in 2024 and 50 in 2025 (notable jump compared to single digits in the 1990s).\n\nMean Citations per Year (MeanTCperYear):\n\nFluctuates from 2.88 (1992) to peaks around 8.86 (2004) and 8.14 (2011).\n\nGenerally, older articles show higher mean citations per year, likely indicating influential or foundational research.\n\nCitable Years:\n\nThe table shows a gradually decreasing number of citable years as the publication date moves closer to the present (e.g., 34 citable years for 1992 vs. 1 for 2025).\n\nThis aligns with the notion that newer articles simply haven’t had as much time to be cited.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nInfluence of Older Publications:\nArticles from the 1990s and early 2000s show high average citations, suggesting they may be seminal works or foundational studies that have consistently been cited over decades.\nCitation Accumulation Over Time:\nThe longer an article has been available, the more citations it tends to accumulate. Hence, recent publications (especially post-2020) naturally exhibit lower citation counts and lower mean citation rates.\nRapid Growth of Publications:\nA significant increase in the number of articles in the 2010s and early 2020s indicates expanding research activity. More scholars entering the field and greater research funding can lead to a higher volume of new work, though these new papers typically need time to garner citations.\nDisparities in Citation Rates:\nSome specific years (e.g., 1996, 2004) show unusually high average citations, possibly indicating particularly influential articles published in those years.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nIn summary, older publications have accrued more citations and thus show higher average totals and yearly citation rates. Meanwhile, the volume of recent publications has grown substantially, but these newer papers have had less time to gather citations. Consequently, the dataset shows a maturing field where both the quantity of research and the range of citation impacts continue to expand.\ngt::gt(AnnualCitPerYear)\n(data/figure/AnnualCitPerYear.png)"

    "text": "Sources\n\nMost Relevant Sources\n\nDescription\n\n\nTop 5 Sources:\n\nTourism Management leads with 108 articles.\n\nJournal of Travel Research (97)\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism (96)\n\nCurrent Issues in Tourism (90)\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research (73)\n\nNext Tier of Journals:\n\nInternational Journal of Tourism Research (69), Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management (55), Tourism Management Perspectives (51), Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research (49), and International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management (46) also feature prominently.\n\nModerate Contribution:\n\nA range of journals contribute between 10 and 40 articles, such as Journal of Destination Marketing & Management (42) and Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing (41).\n\nSeveral niche or regionally focused journals (e.g., Anatolia-International Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Research, Tourism and Hospitality Research) have counts in the teens or single digits.\n\nLong Tail of Sources:\n\nMany journals have fewer than 10 articles. These include specialized outlets (e.g., Journal of Ecotourism, Tourist Studies) and multidisciplinary journals that occasionally cover tourism themes (e.g., European Sport Management Quarterly, Sport in Society).\n\nA handful of publications feature only 1 or 2 articles, likely representing specialized or newer outlets.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nDominance of Core Tourism Journals:\nThe top five clearly include major tourism research outlets, underscoring their leadership and high visibility in the field. Their prominence indicates that they are go-to journals for scholars seeking to disseminate influential work.\nDiverse Publication Platforms:\nThe broad spread of journals, from dedicated tourism/hospitality outlets to interdisciplinary publications (e.g., International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching, Sport Management Review), reflects the multidisciplinary nature of tourism research. Scholars engage with tourism in relation to hospitality, recreation, heritage, and sports, indicating cross-field collaboration.\nGlobal and Niche Perspectives:\nJournals such as Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research highlight regional focuses, while others (e.g., Tourism Geographies, Tourist Studies) emphasize specific thematic or methodological lenses. This diversity shows the field’s richness and its multiple research avenues.\nEmerging or Specialized Outlets:\nOutlets with fewer articles likely represent emerging journals, specialized niches, or newly indexed publications. They can still be influential within particular subfields or geographic contexts.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nOverall, Tourism Management, Journal of Travel Research, and Journal of Sustainable Tourism head the list, illustrating their central roles in the dissemination of tourism scholarship. The breadth of titles confirms the multidisciplinary, global scope of research in tourism and hospitality, encompassing both highly specialized and more general outlets.\nIn summary, these data underscore the core journals that carry the bulk of tourism research output, as well as the growing ecosystem of specialized or interdisciplinary publications contributing to the field.\n\n\nMost Local Cited Sources\n\nDescription\n\n\nTop-Tier Citations:\n\nTourism Management (TOURISM MANAGE) tops the list with 7,488 local citations, followed by\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research (ANN TOURISM RES) with 7,041,\n\nJournal of Travel Research entries combined (abbreviated as J TRAVEL RES = 3,793 and spelled out as JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH = 1,589) total over 5,300 citations if considered together,\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism also appears twice (J SUSTAIN TOUR = 2,411 and JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM = 423), suggesting a large overall impact.\n\nKey Tourism and Hospitality Outlets:\nBesides the highest-cited titles above, other influential journals include Current Issues in Tourism (CURR ISSUES TOUR = 1,709), International Journal of Hospitality Management (1,682), International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management (1,311), and Tourism Management Perspectives (1,088).\nInterdisciplinary and Methodological Sources:\nNoteworthy entries from broader disciplines include:\n\nJournal of Business Research (1,152)\n\nSocial Indicators Research (726)\n\nPsychological Bulletin (519)\n\nMultivariate Data Analysis: A Global Perspective (240)\n\nStructural Equation Modeling (115)\n\nScience (107)\nThese highlight cross-disciplinary influences and methodological underpinnings within tourism research.\n\nDiverse Topic Coverage:\nSeveral other psychology or marketing journals, like Journal of Consumer Research, Journal of Applied Psychology, and Journal of Marketing, each exceed 400 local citations. There is also representation from sustainability (Sustainability-Basel, 971; Ecological Economics, 155), indicating an environmental focus within tourism research.\nOverlap in Abbreviated vs. Full Journal Titles:\nSome journals appear under both abbreviated and full titles (e.g., J TRAVEL RES and JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH), artificially splitting their total citations.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCentral Role of Specialized Tourism Journals:\n\nThe dominance of Tourism Management and Annals of Tourism Research confirms their status as leading authorities in tourism scholarship.\n\nWhen combined, different listings for Journal of Travel Research and Journal of Sustainable Tourism confirm they also command high local citations, placing them squarely among the discipline’s core references.\n\nSignificance of Interdisciplinary Support:\n\nThe presence of business, psychology, and sustainability journals (e.g., Journal of Business Research, Psychological Bulletin, Sustainability-Basel) underscores the multidisciplinary nature of tourism studies.\n\nResearchers frequently draw on marketing and psychological theories, as well as sustainability frameworks, to inform tourism-based inquiries.\n\nMethodological Foundation:\n\nCitations to Multivariate Data Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling reflect that quantitative, rigorous statistical approaches are widely employed in tourism research, emphasizing sophisticated analysis techniques.\n\nPossibility of Citation Inflation via Duplicate Entries:\n\nSome journals (e.g., J TRAVEL RES vs. JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH) appear twice, indicating that aggregated citations would be higher if merged.\n\nThis duplication suggests that authors may cite the same source using different abbreviations, reflecting standard inconsistencies in bibliographic data.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nOverall, Tourism Management, Annals of Tourism Research, and Journal of Travel Research (in both abbreviated and full forms) are at the forefront, reflecting their longstanding influence. The dataset also shows a broad interdisciplinary reach, with high citation counts for psychology, business, and sustainability journals. Further, the usage of advanced research methods is evident, pointing to a mature and methodologically robust field.\nIn summary, these citation patterns underscore the central role of leading tourism journals, the cross-disciplinary integrations shaping the field, and the methodological depth that tourism scholars employ in their research.\n#| message: false #| warning: false #| paged-print: true library(dplyr) gt::gt(MostLocCitSources %&gt;% filter(Articles &gt;= 100))\n(data/figure/MostLocCitSources.png)\n\n\nBradford’s Law\n\nDescription\n\n\nZonal Distribution: According to Bradford’s Law, the journals are divided into three zones:\n\nZone 1 (Core): Ranks 1–6, where each journal has the highest frequency of articles.\n\nZone 2: Ranks 7–19, which collectively contribute the next significant portion of articles.\n\nZone 3: Ranks 20–92, comprising the largest set of journals but each contributing fewer articles individually.\n\nZone 1 Journals (Ranks 1–6)\n\nTourism Management (108 articles)\n\nJournal of Travel Research (97)\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism (96)\n\nCurrent Issues in Tourism (90)\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research (73)\n\nInternational Journal of Tourism Research (69)\n\nTogether, they have a cumulative frequency of 533 articles. This comparatively small group accounts for a large share of the total documents, reflecting their high impact and centrality in the field.\nZone 2 Journals (Ranks 7–19)\n\nIncludes journals such as Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management (55 articles), Tourism Management Perspectives (51), and Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research (49).\n\nTheir cumulative frequency extends from 588 up to 1043, indicating they collectively represent another substantial fraction of the total publications.\n\nZone 3 Journals (Ranks 20–92)\n\nContains the majority of the listed journals (from Journal of Vacation Marketing at rank 20 to Sport Business and Management at rank 92).\n\nEach source contributes fewer articles, but in aggregate they form the largest zone, reflecting the breadth and diversity of niche or emerging outlets in tourism and hospitality research.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nClear Core Group:\nZone 1 journals (the top six) are widely recognized as key outlets in tourism research. Their high article frequencies signify their central role in disseminating foundational and cutting-edge studies.\nSecondary But Still Significant Contributors:\nZone 2 journals each have notable publication counts, reinforcing their status as important, although slightly less central, publication avenues. They often cater to particular subfields or combine tourism with other related disciplines (e.g., hospitality, recreation, or destination management).\nLong Tail in Zone 3:\nThe largest cluster includes many specialized or regional journals. While each has fewer publications, collectively they offer diverse perspectives and niche contributions to the field. This distribution aligns with Bradford’s Law, showing how research output is concentrated in a small number of core sources, with a wide array of additional journals making smaller but collectively significant contributions.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nBy applying Bradford’s Law, we see a high concentration of articles in a small group of journals (Zone 1), followed by a moderately sized set (Zone 2), and a broad “long tail” (Zone 3).\nIn summary, the data confirm that a few core journals (Tourism Management, Journal of Travel Research, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, etc.) dominate the field, while many other journals contribute essential but more specialized insights. This distribution reflects a mature academic domain in which recognized flagship journals coexist alongside numerous specialized outlets, together shaping the multi-faceted landscape of tourism and hospitality scholarship.\ngt::gt(BradfordLaw)\n(data/figure/BradfordLaw.png)\n\n\nSources’ Local Impact\n\nDescription\n\n\nHigh-impact Leaders\n\nTourism Management (h-index = 54) stands out with the highest h-index, followed by Annals of Tourism Research (40) and Journal of Travel Research (40).\n\nThe g-index values follow a similar pattern, with Tourism Management (g = 98), Annals of Tourism Research (73), and Journal of Travel Research (74) at the forefront.\n\nTotal Citations (TC) and Number of Publications (NP)\n\nTourism Management again tops the list with 9,706 total citations across 108 publications, reflecting both volume and influence.\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research (TC = 6,712; NP = 73) and Journal of Travel Research (TC = 5,595; NP = 97) also show high visibility and citation impact.\n\nm-index (Years Normalized)\n\nTourism Management and Journal of Travel Research share a high m-index of 2.35, indicating that even when controlling for how long they’ve been publishing in this dataset (PY_start), they maintain strong citation momentum year over year.\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism (m = 1.89) also exhibits a robust rate of accumulating citations since 2008.\n\nEmerging or Specialized Journals\n\nMany journals further down the list have lower h-index and g-index scores (e.g., h-index &lt; 10). Some have relatively high m-index values despite lower absolute citation counts, indicating rapid growth within fewer years of publication history (e.g., Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, h=18, m=1.8, started in 2016).\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCore Influence of Established Titles:\nThe highest h-index and g-index values cluster around long-standing, flagship tourism journals, confirming their role as core venues where influential and widely cited research is published.\nRole of Publication Timeline:\nThe m-index (which normalizes the h-index by publication years) reveals that newer outlets can still accumulate citations rapidly if they publish high-impact studies. For example, Tourism Management Perspectives (m = 2.09, started in 2015) has gained traction quickly, suggesting it’s an emerging high-impact venue.\nBreadth of Field Maturity:\nJournals with moderate or low h-index/g-index but strong niche focus (e.g., Information Technology & Tourism) indicate the specialized sub-areas within tourism scholarship. They may have fewer articles overall but still contribute valuable, specialized insights.\nInfluence of Journal Age:\nSome older journals (e.g., Annals of Tourism Research, started 1992) have large total citation counts thanks to decades-long scholarship. In contrast, newly launched or recently included journals may show lower overall metrics simply due to less citation-accumulation time.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe data reinforce the dominant local impact of long-established tourism journals, particularly Tourism Management, Annals of Tourism Research, and Journal of Travel Research. They feature the highest h-index and citation counts, underscoring their central role in advancing tourism scholarship. Meanwhile, newer or more specialized journals can still exhibit a strong m-index, reflecting rapid citation growth in emerging areas.\nIn summary, the local impact indicators (h-index, g-index, m-index, total citations) demonstrate a well-defined hierarchy of core tourism journals while highlighting the potential for newer outlets to build influence quickly through highly cited research.\ngt::gt(SourceLocImpact)\n(data/figure/SourceLocImpact.png)\n\n\nSources’ Production over Time\n\nDescription\n\nThe table shows the yearly publication counts from 1992 to 2025 for ten leading journals in tourism and hospitality:\n\nTourism Management\n\nJournal of Travel Research\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism\n\nCurrent Issues in Tourism\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research\n\nInternational Journal of Tourism Research\n\nJournal of Hospitality and Tourism Management\n\nTourism Management Perspectives\n\nAsia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research\n\nInternational Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management\n\n\nEarly Years (1992–2002)\n\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research dominates the early phase, appearing as early as 1992 with 1 publication, incrementally increasing to 4 publications by 2001.\n\nOther journals show zero publications during this period (e.g., Tourism Management, Journal of Travel Research).\n\n\nMid-Years (2003–2010)\n\n\nTourism Management starts contributing in 2003 with 1 publication, growing to 9 publications by 2010.\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research remains strong, going from 5 (2003) to 12 (2010).\n\nJournal of Travel Research emerges around 2009 with 2 publications, rising to 4 by 2010.\n\nInternational Journal of Tourism Research begins in 2008 with 1 article and reaches 4 by 2010.\n\n\nGrowth Phase (2011–2015)\n\n\nTourism Management and Annals of Tourism Research steadily increase. For example, Tourism Management rises from 9 (2011) to 22 (2015).\n\nJournal of Travel Research climbs from 9 (2011) to 20 (2015).\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism picks up pace, moving from 1 in 2010 to 14 in 2015.\n\nCurrent Issues in Tourism also starts to gain momentum, reaching 8 by 2015.\n\n\nAcceleration Period (2016–2020)\n\n\nTourism Management demonstrates a notable surge, growing from 33 (2016) to 70 (2020).\n\nJournal of Travel Research expands from 28 (2016) to 45 (2020).\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism grows quickly, from 18 (2016) to 43 (2020).\n\nTourism Management Perspectives (introduced in 2015) exhibits rapid early expansion, reaching 18 publications by 2020.\n\nInternational Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management increases from 3 (2016) to 22 (2020).\n\n\nRecent Years (2021–2025)\n\n\nContinued upward trend across all journals, with Tourism Management reaching 108 by 2025.\n\nJournal of Travel Research hits 97, Journal of Sustainable Tourism 96, and Current Issues in Tourism 90 by 2025.\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research stabilizes at 73 from 2024 to 2025, suggesting a plateau in this dataset.\n\nInternational Journal of Tourism Research hits 69, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management 55, and Tourism Management Perspectives 51 by 2025, all indicating robust yet slightly lower counts than the top three.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nDominance Shift Over Time\n\nWhile Annals of Tourism Research was the earliest mover, Tourism Management eventually overtakes it in volume. Similarly, Journal of Travel Research shows later but sustained growth, indicating a dynamic shift of publication leadership.\n\nRise of Sustainability and Specialized Focus\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism experiences a substantial lift after the mid-2000s. This may reflect the growing global emphasis on sustainable practices and research funding or academic interest in this subfield.\n\nEmergence of New Titles\n\nTourism Management Perspectives launched around 2015 and grows quickly, suggesting a demand for alternative outlets or specific focus areas within tourism management.\n\nAsia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research also gains traction steadily from the 2010s onward, highlighting the regional research expansion in tourism.\n\nOverall Increasing Trend\n\nNearly all titles show an upward trend in publication counts, which underscores the rapid expansion of tourism and hospitality research overall.\n\nThe convergence of counts by 2025 reveals multiple well-established journals in this domain rather than one or two dominating. This diversification indicates a maturing field with varied themes and focal areas.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nIn summary, the data reflect the evolution of tourism and hospitality scholarship over three decades. Early on, Annals of Tourism Research led the field; however, Tourism Management and Journal of Travel Research later rose to the forefront, indicating shifts in scholarly emphasis. The emergence and rapid rise of specialized journals (e.g., Journal of Sustainable Tourism, Tourism Management Perspectives) align with evolving research interests (sustainability, specialized management approaches). Ultimately, the growing publication counts suggest a highly active and continually diversifying research landscape.\ngt::gt(SourceProdOverTime)\n(data/figure/SourceProdOverTime.png)"

Researchers are forming teams to tackle complex topics, share expertise, and leverage cross-institutional resources.\n\nGlobalization and Diversity\n\nThe presence of a vast array of names from varied linguistic backgrounds signals a global research network. Collaboration extends across continents, reflecting the international nature of tourism and hospitality studies.\n\nPotential Niche or Emergent Scholars\n\nThe numerous authors with 1 or 2 articles might be:\n\nEarly-career academics entering the field,\n\nPractitioners co-authoring in specialized areas, or\n\nOccasional contributors from adjacent disciplines (e.g., psychology, marketing, sustainability).\n\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nIn summary, a small group of highly prolific authors stands out, evidenced by both total and fractionalized article counts. The extensive collaborations indicated by fractional authorship counts reflect the team-based, interdisciplinary nature of tourism research. Meanwhile, the long tail of smaller contributors underscores the field’s broad appeal and global reach.\nOverall, the data reveal a dynamic scholarly community with a few leading figures and many emergent or specialized voices, collectively shaping the ongoing development of tourism and hospitality research.\ngt::gt(MostRelAuthors %&gt;% filter(Articles &gt;= 6))\n(data/figure/MostRelAuthors.png)\n\n\nMost Local Cited Authors\nThe provided bibliometric analysis focuses on “most local citations” related to the field. “Local citations” typically refer to the number of times an author’s work is cited by other works within a specific dataset or field of study.\n\nDescription\n\n\nTop Local Citations\n\nUYSAL M leads with 1049 local citations, significantly ahead of all other authors.\n\nSIRGY MJ (830) and KIM H (654) also show notably high citation counts.\n\nOthers with 500+ citations include WOO E (536) and NAWIJN J (385).\n\nBroad Range of Citation Counts\n\nAfter the top tier (500+ citations), a long list of authors have citations ranging from a few hundred to single digits.\n\nThe dataset extends down to authors with 1 or 2 local citations, indicating a wide citation distribution across many contributors.\n\nEvidence of Numerous Contributors\n\nHundreds of authors appear, reflecting broad, collaborative research in the field.\n\nMany authors beyond the top 10–20 still maintain respectable citation counts (e.g., 50–200), underscoring a robust middle tier.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nInfluential Scholars\n\nHigh local citations (500+) often align with well-established researchers who have published extensively on seminal or in-demand topics (e.g., tourism impact, quality of life, hospitality management).\n\nUYSAL M and SIRGY MJ are prime examples of researchers whose foundational theories or frameworks likely generate ongoing citations.\n\nAcademic Focus and Collaboration\n\nThe number of authors listed indicates a wide-reaching, collaborative field.\n\nAuthors in the 100–300 citation range often engage in multiple co-authored projects across sub-disciplines (e.g., destination marketing, sustainable tourism). Their citation impact suggests relevance and consistent publication but perhaps with more specialized or emergent topics.\n\nLong Tail of New or Specialized Contributors\n\nMany authors with fewer citations could be early-career academics, occasional contributors, or scholars from related disciplines publishing in tourism/hospitality.\n\nThis “long tail” phenomenon is typical of a mature field, where a few authors lead in citations, but many still contribute in niche areas or collaborative projects.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nOverall, local citation counts reveal a core group of highly influential authors (e.g., Uysal, Sirgy, Kim) shaping major discussions in tourism and hospitality research. A substantial middle tier indicates a healthy ecosystem of established scholars, while the long tail underscores ongoing influx of new or specialized voices.\nIn summary, the breadth of authors and their varying citation levels signal a diverse and dynamic research community, with a few standout leaders consistently driving the field’s academic conversations.\ngt::gt(MostLocCitAuthors %&gt;% filter(LocalCitations &gt;= 100))\n(data/figure/MostLocCitAuthors.png)\n\n\nAuthors’ Production over Time\nThis bibliometric analysis reflects the scholarly publications on the topic by various authors over the years. Let’s elaborate on the results, particularly focusing on the “authors’ production over time”:\n\nDescription\n\n\nCore Research Themes\n\nThe recurring focus is on well-being, quality of life (QOL), mental health, residents’ attitudes, and community development in tourism contexts.\n\nMany articles connect destination competitiveness, tourism experience, and sustainability to subjective well-being, underscoring how travelers’ and residents’ lives are impacted by tourism.\n\nTemporal and Topical Evolution\n\nEarlier Publications (2010–2013) emphasize foundational ideas:\n\nThe concept of holiday happiness curves\n\nMeasuring tourists’ changing emotions over trip durations\n\nLinks between leisure travel and life satisfaction\n\n\nMid-Period (2014–2017):\n\nA surge in co-creation and community-based tourism research\n\nGreater interest in nature-based or heritage tourism and their influences on well-being\n\nEmergence of casinos/gaming and festival events to study impacts on host communities’ QOL\n\nRecent Years (2018–2025):\n\nFocused on digital/virtual experiences, metaverse or VR tourism, and live streaming\n\nMental health and employee well-being in hospitality contexts\n\nDiaspora festivals, transnational religious tourism, and interdisciplinary approaches to QOL measurement\n\n\nHigh Citation vs. New Publications\n\nOlder, seminal articles (e.g., 2015–2016) often have very high total citations and a notable citations per year (TCpY).\n\nMany 2024–2025 publications show low or zero total citations due to their recent release, though some indicate promising themes (e.g., mental health, VR tourism) that align with emerging industry and societal trends.\n\nKey Authors and Contribution\n\nUYSAL M appears extensively, highlighting a strong research focus on quality of life, well-being metrics, and destination performance.\n\nFILEP S consistently explores tourist well-being from a positive psychology perspective, including hedonic/eudaimonic frameworks.\n\nKIM S, KIM H, SU LJ, and others analyze resident-tourist interactions, festival experiences, and community empowerment.\n\nRasoolimanesh SM, Ramkissoon H, Prayag G, Croes R, etc., focus on sustainable tourism and destination management through quality-of-life lenses.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nGrowing Importance of Well-Being Paradigms\n\nThe repeated emphasis on quality of life and subjective well-being indicates a paradigm shift: tourism success is no longer measured solely by economic gains, but also by social, psychological, and environmental dimensions.\n\nInterdisciplinary and Global Collaboration\n\nMany articles integrate frameworks from psychology (e.g., PERMA model), sociology (solidarity, empowerment), and business/marketing (value co-creation), showcasing cross-disciplinary research designs.\n\nTopics like virtual reality or metaverse tourism reveal expansions into technological and digital aspects of tourism experiences.\n\nAttention to Diverse Stakeholders\n\nAuthors increasingly examine residents’ attitudes, empowerment, and social responsibility—indicating that the host community perspective is central to sustainable tourism.\n\nThere is also attention to employees’ mental health and hospitality workplace well-being, reflecting a holistic industry approach.\n\nContinued Innovation\n\nMost recent publications (2023–2025) delve into new theories (e.g., diaspora and spiritual festivals, pet-accompanying tourism, K-pop music tourism, AI usage) to clarify how tourism fosters or hampers well-being across contexts.\n\nThese directions suggest an ongoing evolution of tourism scholarship toward more nuanced, human-centric frameworks.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nOverall, the dataset underscores a dynamic and continually diversifying field of tourism research, with well-being and quality of life emerging as central metrics of both traveler and resident outcomes. The broad range of authors, years, and interdisciplinary theories reveal how tourism and hospitality scholarship is expanding to include technological, social, and psychological determinants of success.\nIn summary, the collective publications illustrate a mature research landscape increasingly focused on sustainability, mental health, and community well-being—a vital shift from purely economic perspectives to holistic measures of tourism’s impact.\ngt::gt(AuthorProdOverTime)\n(data/figure/AuthorProdOverTime.png)\n\n\nLotka’s Law\nLotka’s Law is a fundamental principle in bibliometrics and scientometrics, which are fields concerned with the quantitative study of scientific and technological literature. Named after Alfred J. Lotka, who proposed the idea in 1926, this law describes the frequency with which authors publish in a particular field.\nLotka’s Law can be represented mathematically as:\n\\[ Y = \\frac{C} {X^{\\alpha}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n$ Y $ is the number of authors making $ X $ contributions\n$ C $ is a constant (it describes the number of authors making only one contribution)\n$ $ is a constant usually close to 2 (though it can vary depending on the discipline).\n\nInterpretation of Lotka’s Law:\n\nMajority Publishes Once: A large number of authors will have only one publication, which corresponds to the value of $ C $.\nDecrease in Frequency: As the number of publications per author (i.e., productivity) increases, the number of authors who have published that many times decreases, and this decrease is very sharp (often described as an inverse square law).\nFew Prolific Authors: Only a very small number of authors will be responsible for a large portion of the publications in a particular field. This can be thought of as the “80-20” principle, where a minority (often around 20%) of authors produce the majority (around 80%) of the work.\n\nApplication:\n\nIdentify Core Authors: By applying Lotka’s Law, organizations and researchers can identify the core authors or the most prolific contributors in a particular field or topic.\nAnalysis of Scientific Output: Lotka’s Law can be utilized to analyze the scientific output of a field, helping in recognizing the distribution of productivity among authors.\nResearch Evaluation: Research institutions might use this principle to evaluate the research output of their faculty or departments, understanding the distribution of prolific authors versus those who publish less frequently.\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that while Lotka’s Law provides a useful general observation about scientific productivity, there are variations depending on the specific scientific discipline or field of study. The values of $ C $ and $ alpha $ might differ across disciplines, and in some cases, other bibliometric models might offer a better fit to the data.\n\nMeasurement for the Lotka’s law is the following:\n\nN.Articles: This is the number of articles written by an author.\nN.Authors: This is the number of authors who have written the corresponding N.Articles.\nFreq: This is the frequency (proportion) of those authors relative to the total number of authors.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe table shows how many authors have published N articles, alongside the frequency of authors for each N.\n\nHighest Frequency at N=1:\n\n2613 authors (80.20%) have just 1 article, the largest group, indicating a “long tail” of contributors.\n\nThis high proportion of single-publication authors is typical in many scholarly fields, aligning with the inverse-square or inverse-power distribution suggested by Lotka’s Law.\n\nGradual Decrease for Higher N:\n\nAs the number of articles authored (N) increases, the number of authors contributing that many articles decreases sharply. For instance:\n\n2 articles: 377 authors (11.57%)\n\n3 articles: 106 authors (3.25%)\n\n5 articles: 31 authors (0.95%)\n\nVery few authors produce more than 10 articles.\n\n\nVery Productive Authors:\n\nOnly 1 author has produced 27 articles, one has 22, and one has 20, illustrating the pattern in which a tiny minority of authors contributes a large volume of publications.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nClassic Power-Law Behavior:\nThe table demonstrates a steep power-law (or Lotka-like) distribution, where most authors publish just once, while a small subset of highly productive authors accounts for many publications.\nField Maturity and Broad Inclusion:\nThe large proportion of single-publication authors signals:\n\nField Openness: Many researchers (possibly from adjacent disciplines) publish occasionally in this domain.\n\nPotential Collaboration: Some of these single-publication authors may be graduate students or co-authors with senior researchers, indicating a collaborative environment.\n\nIdentification of Core Authors:\nA handful of authors consistently publishing 10+ articles are likely key influencers or thought leaders in the research area. Their high productivity positions them at the center of scholarly discourse.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe data conform well to Lotka’s Law, illustrating a typical author productivity pattern: 1. Most authors publish one article only.\n2. A much smaller group demonstrates moderate productivity (2–5 articles).\n3. An extremely small cohort of authors achieve high productivity (10+ articles).\nIn summary, these findings highlight a highly skewed productivity distribution common in scientific fields, where a majority of authors contribute a single study, and a small group drives a significant fraction of the total output.\ngt::gt(LotkaLaw)\n(data/figure/LotkaLaw.png)\n\n\nAuthors’ Local Impact\n\nThe followings are the measurement of the local impact\n\nElement: Name of the author.\nh_index: h-index of the author, which represents the maximum number of articles an author has written that have received at least the same number of citations.\ng_index: g-index of the author, a metric that takes into account the distribution of citations received by a researcher’s publications.\nm_index: Rate of acquiring h-index points. It is calculated by dividing the h-index by the number of years since the first published paper of the author.\nTC: Total citations the author has received.\nNP: Number of publications by the author.\nPY_start: The year of the author’s first publication.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nHigh-Impact Leaders:\n\nUYSAL M stands out with an h-index of 16 and g-index of 27 from 27 publications (TC = 3007) since his first publication in 2013. His m-index of 1.23 indicates robust citation accumulation per year.\nNAWIJN J (h = 14, g = 15, NP = 15, TC = 1219, PY_start = 2010) and FILEP S (h = 13, g = 22, NP = 22, TC = 582, PY_start = 2012) follow as influential authors in the dataset.\n\nDiverse Productivity and Citation Profiles:\n\nSome authors, like SU LJ (h = 13, m = 1.18) and KIM H (h = 10, m = 0.91), show a solid balance between publication output and impact.\n\nIn contrast, LEE CK (h = 11, m = 0.48) has a longer career starting in 2003 with 13 articles, but a lower m-index indicates slower yearly citation accumulation.\n\nVaried Career Stages:\n\nThe starting years (PY_start) range from as early as 2003 (e.g., LEE CK) to more recent years such as 2020–2021 (e.g., ALRAWADIEH Z, WEN J), reflecting both long-established and emerging voices.\nThe m-index (TC/NP normalized by career length) helps compare authors across different career spans, revealing that more recent authors can achieve high annual impact even with fewer publications.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCitation Impact vs. Publication Volume:\n\nA high h-index and g-index generally point to a consistent influence of an author’s work. For instance, UYSAL M’s metrics (16/27) reflect that many of his 27 articles are highly cited.\n\nAuthors like NAWIJN J, with 15 publications and an h-index of 14, demonstrate that nearly every publication has contributed to his citation profile.\n\nNormalized Productivity (m-index):\n\nThe m-index gives insight into the annual impact. UYSAL M’s m-index of 1.23 is particularly strong considering he started in 2013, meaning he has averaged a good citation rate each year.\n\nLower m-index values (e.g., LEE CK’s 0.48) can be attributed to a longer career span where earlier publications may have had less impact or a slower rate of citation growth.\n\nField Evolution and Emerging Scholars:\n\nAuthors with later start years (e.g., ALRAWADIEH Z, MITAS O) and relatively high m-index values suggest that newer contributions are quickly gaining recognition.\n\nThe range of indices across authors reflects the interdisciplinary and evolving nature of the field, where both established researchers and newer entrants contribute to its growth.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe local impact metrics reveal a hierarchy of influence: - Core leaders like UYSAL M, NAWIJN J, FILEP S, and SU LJ have achieved high citation impact relative to their output, indicating that their work is both prolific and influential. - Normalized indices (m-index) help account for differences in career duration, showing that newer authors can be very impactful on an annual basis. - Variations in metrics among authors with similar publication counts (NP) underline differences in citation performance and influence.\nIn summary, the data show a skewed distribution where a relatively small group of authors achieves high impact (reflected by high h- and g-indices and m-index values), while others have moderate performance. This pattern is typical in many academic fields, indicating that a few key researchers drive the bulk of the influential scholarship.\ngt::gt(AuthorLocImpact %&gt;% filter(h_index &gt;= 5))\n(data/figure/AuthorLocImpact.png)\n\n\n\n\nAffiliations\n\nMost Relevant Affiliations\nThe data provided is a bibliometric analysis focusing on the affiliations that have contributed to research related to psychological entitlement. Bibliometric analyses help understand the research landscape of a specific topic by evaluating the academic output from various institutions. The data lists different university systems and universities with the number of articles they’ve published on the topic.\n\nDescription\n\n\nTop Affiliations by Article Count:\n\nSTATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF FLORIDA leads with 104 articles.\nHONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY follows closely with 97 articles.\nGRIFFITH UNIVERSITY contributes 73 articles, while SUN YAT SEN UNIVERSITY and UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA add 56 and 55 articles, respectively.\n\nDiverse Global Representation:\n\nThe list features institutions from North America (e.g., University of Central Florida, Texas A&M University System, Purdue University System), Asia (e.g., Sun Yat Sen University, Kyung Hee University, Zhejiang University), Australia (e.g., Griffith University, University of Queensland), and Europe (e.g., University of Surrey, Bournemouth University).\nSome systems and multi-campus networks (e.g., Texas A&M University System, California State University System) indicate that research in tourism is often supported by large academic networks.\n\nSpecialized and Regional Institutions:\n\nA number of affiliations are focused on regional and applied research (e.g., Breda University of Applied Sciences, Macau University of Science and Technology), suggesting a strong applied orientation in tourism scholarship.\nThere are also specialized institutions that appear to concentrate on tourism/hospitality studies, such as City University of Macau and Taylor’s University.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nGeographic Diversity and Focus:\n\nThe high-ranking affiliations come from regions with dynamic tourism sectors, suggesting that local industry relevance and regional economic importance drive research output.\nInstitutions from Florida, Hong Kong, and Australia dominate, reflecting their strong tourism industries and established research infrastructures.\n\nInstitutional Networks and Research Clusters:\n\nUniversity systems (e.g., State University System of Florida, Texas A&M University System, California State University System) contribute significantly, demonstrating the role of institutional networks in fostering collaborative and high-volume research.\nThe presence of both comprehensive universities and specialized institutions points to a balance between theoretical and applied research in tourism and hospitality.\n\nImpact on Policy and Practice:\n\nLeading institutions often inform both academic debates and practical policy decisions in tourism. Their high article counts suggest they are key players in shaping sustainable tourism practices and industry standards.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nOverall, the distribution of articles across affiliations shows a broad and globally diverse network of institutions contributing to tourism research. A few key players—especially from regions with strong tourism industries—dominate the field, while a wide range of universities, from large state systems to specialized and regional institutions, enrich the research landscape with varied perspectives and applied insights.\nIn summary, the data underscore that major research outputs in tourism are concentrated in a handful of influential affiliations, reflecting regional economic importance, robust institutional networks, and a balance between theoretical and practical contributions in the field.\ngt::gt(MostRelAffiliations %&gt;% filter(Articles &gt;= 20))\n(data/figure/MostRelAffiliations.png)\n\n\nAffiliations’ Production over time\nThe table provided represents a bibliometric analysis of the production of articles related across different universities and university systems over a span of approximately two decades. Here’s an elaboration and interpretation of the results for each institution:\n\nDescription\n\nThe table displays the yearly article output for several key affiliations in tourism research. Notable patterns include:\n\nDelayed Start & Gradual Onset:\n\nMany institutions (e.g., Kyung Hee University, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, University of Queensland, and State University System of Florida) show no production in the early 1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nProduction begins modestly (often 1–2 articles per year) in the mid-2000s.\n\nSteady Increase with Recent Acceleration:\n\nOver time, article counts gradually increase. For example, Kyung Hee University increases from 2–5 articles in the 2003–2013 period, reaching 13–14 articles by 2019–2021, and then leaping to 39–40 articles in 2024–2025.\n\nHong Kong Polytechnic University similarly grows slowly until around 2014–2015, then accelerates dramatically: from 10 articles in 2016 to 90–97 articles by 2024–2025.\n\nOther affiliations, such as the State University System of Florida and University of Central Florida, show a similar pattern—little or no output in the early years and then a rapid ramp-up in the 2010s, peaking in the early 2020s.\n\nVariation Among Institutions:\n\nWhile some institutions like University of Queensland and Sun Yat Sen University also show an upward trend, the magnitude and pace vary.\n\nFor instance, Universidade do Algarve had negligible output until 2017 and then a marked increase in recent years (from 1 article per year up to 39–40 articles by 2024–2025).\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nField Maturation and Increased Emphasis:\nThe nearly universal absence of articles before the mid-2000s suggests that tourism research, at least as indexed in this dataset, was either in its infancy or not a priority at many institutions. The subsequent growth reflects:\n\nA maturation of the field as tourism became an increasingly important economic, social, and environmental subject.\nEnhanced institutional support and funding for tourism/hospitality research over time.\n\nExponential Growth in Recent Years:\nThe accelerated output from around 2018 onward for many affiliations (e.g., Hong Kong Polytechnic University, State University System of Florida) likely indicates:\n\nA surge in research interest driven by global trends such as sustainability, digital transformation (e.g., virtual tourism), and the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on travel.\nGreater collaboration and interdisciplinary approaches that boost publication output.\n\nRegional Differences:\nInstitutions in regions with vibrant tourism industries (e.g., Florida, Hong Kong, Australia) exhibit particularly high growth rates. In contrast, some institutions with later entry into the field (e.g., Universidade do Algarve) show a delayed but rapid ramp-up, perhaps as the region’s tourism issues gained prominence.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe data reveal that the production of tourism research has experienced a significant, mostly exponential increase over the past two decades. While many key affiliations showed little or no output in the early years, all have ramped up their production substantially, with especially dramatic increases observed from around 2018 onward.\nIn summary, these trends underscore the growing academic and practical importance of tourism research worldwide. The consistent rise in article output across diverse institutions reflects both a maturing field and the increasing global relevance of tourism, sustainability, and hospitality studies.\ngt::gt(AffOverTime)\n(data/figure/AffOverTime.png)\n\n\n\n\nCountries\n\nCorresponding Author’s Countires\nThe data presented offers a bibliometric analysis of psychological entitlement based on the country of the corresponding author.

For example, China has 174 SCP and 130 MCP, meaning about 42.76% of its output is international collaboration.\n\nThe USA shows a lower international share at 33.72% (173 SCP vs. 88 MCP).\n\nIn contrast, countries such as Korea (68.75% MCP) and Malaysia (68% MCP) have a high proportion of multi-country collaborations.\nSome European countries (e.g., UK at 41.38%, Australia at 49.53%) show a balance between domestic and international outputs, whereas others (e.g., Spain at 26.03%, India at 14.58%) lean more toward domestic research.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nVolume and Influence:\n\nThe top-producing countries (China, USA, UK, Australia) dominate overall production. Their high output may be driven by strong national research systems, significant tourism industries, and a high level of academic investment in tourism and hospitality studies.\n\nInternational Collaboration Trends:\n\nHigher MCP percentages in countries like Korea and Malaysia suggest that researchers there are highly engaged in cross-border collaborations. This can enrich research by bringing diverse perspectives and may reflect the strategic importance of global networks in rapidly evolving tourism contexts.\nLower MCP percentages for countries like India and Spain indicate that a larger share of their research is produced domestically. This might reflect either a strong local research community or less integration into international collaborative networks.\n\nRegional Dynamics:\n\nMany of the top-producing countries are from regions with vibrant tourism industries and strong governmental or institutional support for tourism research. The collaboration patterns can also hint at differences in research culture—some regions may prioritize international partnership while others focus on addressing local issues.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThese country-level data reveal that a few countries (China and the USA, in particular) produce a significant share of tourism research, while international collaboration levels vary considerably. Higher international collaboration percentages in countries like Korea and Malaysia suggest that global networks play a critical role in advancing their research, whereas other nations tend to produce more domestic work.\nIn summary, the data underscore both the concentration of research output in a few major countries and the diverse collaboration strategies that reflect regional priorities and research cultures in the field of tourism and hospitality.\ngt::gt(CorrAuthCountries)\n(data/figure/CorrAuthCountries.png)\n\n\nCountries’ Scientific Production\n\nDescription\n\n\nTop Producers by Region:\n\nChina leads with 774 publications, followed by the USA (679) and Australia (287).\n\nOther significant contributors include the UK (282), Spain (172), Portugal (171), and South Korea (170). These regions represent a major portion of global tourism research output.\n\nModerate Contribution from Other Regions:\n\nCountries such as India (105), New Zealand (82), Malaysia (81), and Canada (70) contribute notably fewer publications but still hold importance in the global tourism research landscape.\n\nSmaller Regional Contributions:\n\nSeveral countries in Europe and Asia have lesser contributions with countries like Finland, Japan, and Austria having around 30–40 publications, showing less intense involvement in tourism research compared to the top countries.\n\nEmerging or Niche Contributors:\n\nSmaller countries like Vietnam (20), Poland (19), Ghana (18), Switzerland (18), Mexico (17), and Russia (17) have a more specialized presence in tourism research.\nEmerging economies such as Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, and Uruguay (2–3 publications) show nascent involvement, possibly linked to the growing interest in tourism within these regions.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nDominance of Major Tourism Markets:\n\nThe most prolific regions—China, USA, Australia, UK—reflect the global tourism leaders in terms of both research output and tourism industry influence. These regions invest significantly in tourism studies due to their established academic and tourism infrastructures.\n\nIncreasing Participation from Asia and Europe:\n\nSouth Korea and Malaysia show a strong growth trend, with South Korea reaching 170 publications. This signals an expanding interest in tourism research in the Asian market, particularly in areas related to culture, sustainability, and technology in tourism.\nPortugal, Spain, and Italy reflect strong regional engagement with tourism, likely tied to the importance of tourism to their respective economies and cultures.\n\nGlobal Disparities in Research Contribution:\n\nRegions like Africa, South America, and parts of Eastern Europe (e.g., Nigeria, Ethiopia, Argentina) contribute relatively fewer articles, signaling potential gaps in academic capacity or less research infrastructure dedicated to tourism.\n\nCountries with fewer publications (e.g., Bhutan, Morocco, Costa Rica) are often niche players, possibly engaged in specific tourism sectors or facing more localized research needs.\n\nResearch Diffusion and Specialization:\n\nCountries like Qatar, Kazakhstan, and Nepal show growing but still modest contributions. This suggests a broadening of tourism scholarship, especially in emerging markets or regions with developing tourism industries.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe data reveal a clear concentration of tourism research in a few regions such as China, the USA, Australia, and the UK, with emerging contributions from countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa. The varying article counts reflect global disparities in research focus, academic infrastructure, and regional tourism development.\nIn summary, the data point to established regions dominating tourism research while others are beginning to engage more actively. This highlights regional specialization and growing interest in tourism research worldwide, indicating the field’s broadening scope and diverse focus areas across the globe.\ngt::gt(CountrySciProd)\n(data/figure/CountrySciProd.png)\n\n\nCountires’ Production over Time\n\nDescription\n\n\nUSA\n\nThe USA shows a gradual increase in publications from 1992 (1 article) to 2025 (679 articles).\nA significant surge begins around 2010, with output increasing from 26 articles in 2010 to 377 articles in 2021.\nPost-2020, the USA maintains strong growth, producing 314 articles in 2020, 457 in 2022, and 650 articles in 2024.\n\nChina\n\nChina starts with almost no publications until 2007 (2 articles), then gradually ramps up in the following years.\nIn recent years, China has seen explosive growth, with 272 articles in 2021, 340 in 2022, and 485 in 2023.\n\nBy 2025, China is projected to produce 774 articles, surpassing the USA.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe UK also sees a steady increase, especially from 2016 (33 articles) to 2025 (282 articles).\n\nA significant jump in production occurs after 2019 as the UK’s article output reaches 94 in 2020 and 154 in 2022.\n\nAustralia\n\nAustralia shows consistent growth from 2006 (1 article) to 287 articles in 2025.\nA major increase occurs in the last decade, from 38 articles in 2016 to 227 articles in 2023, with projections to exceed 282 articles in 2024.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSouth Korea shows a modest but steady rise, starting from 4 articles in 2003 to 170 articles in 2025.\nThe output grows rapidly starting around 2018, with 53 articles in 2019 and 68 in 2020, peaking at 166 articles in 2024.\n\nPortugal\n\nPortugal starts with very few articles and slowly increases production after 2013.

    "text": "Documents\n\nDocuments\n\nMost Global Cited Documents\n\nDescription\n\n\nDocument Diversity:\nThe table lists key documents in tourism research, identified by paper title, DOI, total citations, citations per year, and a normalized citation score. These documents span a range of publication years and include both seminal and more recent contributions.\nCitation Metrics:\n\nTotal Citations (TC) vary widely—from documents with over 700 citations (e.g., SHARPLEY R, 2014 with 704 TC) to those in the lower range (e.g., several papers with TC around 10–20).\nCitations per Year (TC per Year) show how frequently a paper is cited on an annual basis. Notably, some recent documents (e.g., ZHENG DN, 2021 with 97.6 TC per Year) have very high annual citation rates, suggesting rapid recognition.\nNormalized TC adjusts citation counts for factors such as publication age, highlighting the relative impact. Here, values range significantly—for instance, ZHENG DN, 2021 has a normalized TC of 16.27, whereas others are below 1, indicating that some papers are far more influential relative to their publication time.\n\nJournal Sources and Authorship:\nThe documents are published in well-regarded journals (e.g., Annals of Tourism Research, Journal of Travel Research, Tourism Management) and represent contributions from prominent authors, reinforcing their status as key works in the field.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nSeminal Contributions:\nPapers with very high total citations and normalized scores (e.g., SHARPLEY R, 2014 and ZHENG DN, 2021) are likely to be seminal studies. Their high TC per Year values further suggest that these works have had a strong and sustained impact over time.\nRapid Uptake of Recent Research:\nSome recent publications show impressive annual citation rates. For example, ZHENG DN, 2021 achieves 97.6 citations per year, which, when normalized, indicates an exceptional influence compared to peers published in similar time frames.\nRelative Impact Variability:\nThe wide range in normalized TC values reflects differences in how papers perform relative to the expected citation rate for their publication age. Documents with normalized TC values well above 1 are outperforming the typical citation benchmarks in tourism research.\nField Evolution:\nThe mix of older, highly cited documents with more recent works that are rapidly accumulating citations illustrates the dynamic evolution of tourism research. It underscores that while foundational works continue to be referenced, innovative new studies are also making significant impacts.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe analysis of the most globally cited documents in tourism research reveals a heterogeneous but influential set of publications. Key papers—such as those by SHARPLEY R (2014) and ZHENG DN (2021)—demonstrate both high cumulative and annual citation metrics, marking them as seminal contributions. The normalized citation scores further confirm that some documents have an impact far exceeding the norm for their publication period. In summary, this bibliometric snapshot highlights not only the long-standing foundational studies in tourism research but also emerging works that are rapidly shaping the field.\ngt::gt(MostGlobCitDocs %&gt;% filter(Total.Citations &gt;= 10))\n(data/figure/MostGlobCitDocs.png)\n\n\nMost Local Cited Documents\nThis section examines the most locally cited documents in our dataset. The table below provides key metrics for each document including: - Local Citations: Citations received within the local (disciplinary or community-specific) dataset. - Global Citations: Total citations received worldwide. - Ratio: The percentage of local citations relative to global citations. - Normalized Local/Global Citations: Citation counts that have been adjusted (typically by publication age) to allow fairer comparisons across documents.\n\nDescription\n\n\nCitation Distribution\n\nThe documents show a wide variation in both local and global citations. For instance, UYSAL M, 2016, TOURISM MANAGE received 256 local and 554 global citations, whereas other papers in the lower part of the list have local citations as low as 1–2.\nThe Ratio (Local/Global × 100) ranges broadly. Some documents (e.g., UYSAL M, 2016) have a ratio near 46%, meaning nearly half of their citations come from the local community, while others (e.g., SHARPLEY R, 2014) have a lower ratio (~16%), indicating a greater share of citations coming from outside the local context.\n\nNormalized Citation Metrics\n\nThe Normalized Local Citations vary from below 1 to over 14, and the Normalized Global Citations range similarly. These numbers adjust for factors like publication age so that more recent papers are compared fairly with older, more established works.\nFor example, VADA S, 2020, TOUR MANAG PERSPECT shows a high normalized local citation (13.43) compared to a normalized global citation of 3.89, suggesting a very strong local impact relative to its overall citation performance.\n\nPublication Year Spread\n\nThe sample spans from earlier publications (e.g., 2004) to recent works (projected up to 2025). Older documents tend to accumulate higher absolute citation counts, but normalization helps reveal their relative impact when accounting for the time available to be cited.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nLocal vs. Global Impact\n\nA high Local/Global Ratio implies that a document is especially influential within its local research community. For instance, UYSAL M (2016) with a ratio of 46.2% indicates that nearly half of its influence is local.\nConversely, documents with a lower ratio (e.g., SHARPLEY R, 2014 at 16.3%) may have broader global appeal and are cited more by researchers outside the immediate field.\n\nNormalized Citation Insights\n\nThe normalized metrics help in comparing documents of different ages. A high normalized local citation value (such as that for VADA S, 2020) highlights a paper that, despite being newer, has achieved substantial local recognition.\nIn some cases, normalized global citations remain high (e.g., SHARPLEY R, 2014 and KIM K, 2013), indicating that these documents not only serve as core references in the local community but also enjoy widespread international attention.\n\nVariability Across Documents\n\nThe variation in both absolute and normalized citation metrics suggests diversity in research impact. Some papers achieve a strong local resonance while others gain more global recognition.\nThe distribution also reflects disciplinary differences and possibly the evolving citation practices within the field over time.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nConclusion:\nThe analysis of the most locally cited documents reveals distinct patterns of impact. Some documents (e.g., UYSAL M, 2016) are highly influential within the local research community, as evidenced by a high local-to-global citation ratio and strong normalized local citation scores. In contrast, other seminal works such as SHARPLEY R, 2014 are characterized by a lower local ratio, indicating broader international recognition. The normalized metrics further allow us to compare documents across different publication years, highlighting both enduring and emerging contributions.\nSummary:\n- Pattern: Wide variability in local and global citations with ratios ranging from ~16% to over 46%. Normalized metrics adjust for publication age, revealing the relative local and global impacts. - Interpretation: Documents with higher local ratios demonstrate stronger influence within the field’s core community, while those with lower ratios are more globally cited. Normalized values help identify papers that have rapidly accumulated impact relative to their age. - Overall: This bibliometric snapshot underscores the dual dimensions of research influence—local and global—and highlights the dynamic and multifaceted nature of scholarly impact in tourism research.\ngt::gt(MostLocCitDocs %&gt;% filter(Local.Citations &gt;= 10))\n(data/figure/MostLocCitDocs.png)\n\n\n\n\nCited References\n\nMost Local Cited References\n\nDescription\n\n\nSkewed Citation Distribution:\n\nA few foundational works (e.g., Fornell, 1981 with 272 citations; Uysal, 2016 with 256 citations; Hair, 2010 with 240 citations) dominate the citation counts.\nMany other references have citations ranging from the low teens up to around 70, indicating a long tail of influential but less‐cited works.\n\nMultidisciplinary Influences:\n\nThe list includes works from marketing research (e.g., Fornell, 1981; Hair, 2010), psychology (e.g., Maslow, 1943; Kahneman, 2004), and tourism/hospitality (e.g., Uysal, 2016; Chen, 2013).\nThis suggests that local scholarship in tourism draws on a wide range of theories and methodologies.\n\nSeminal Theoretical and Methodological Contributions:\n\nMany references are recognized as key sources for measurement instruments and conceptual frameworks (e.g., the works on structural equation modeling, quality-of-life, and satisfaction).\nSeveral classic texts (e.g., Maslow’s works, Seligman’s writings, and foundational works on social indicators) continue to influence current research.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCentral Role of Seminal Works:\n\nThe highest cited references have become “canonical” in the field, serving as standard benchmarks and foundational theories that shape subsequent research.\nHigh citation counts for works like Fornell (1981) and Uysal (2016) indicate their wide acceptance and use in building and validating measurement models and conceptual frameworks in tourism research.\n\nInterdisciplinary Nature of Research:\n\nThe diversity of sources (from marketing and psychology to tourism and hospitality) highlights the interdisciplinary nature of research in this domain.\nThis integration enriches the field by providing multiple perspectives and robust methodological approaches.\n\nEnduring Influence and Evolving Scholarship:\n\nMany older references (e.g., seminal articles from the 1980s and 1990s) remain highly cited, which underscores their enduring influence.\nNewer works, though cited less in absolute terms, are contributing to contemporary debates and methodologies, as seen with recent articles from 2020 and 2021.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nConclusion:\nThe most locally cited references reveal a heavily skewed distribution where a few seminal works dominate the landscape. These influential texts span across several disciplines, indicating the interdisciplinary foundation of tourism and hospitality research. They serve as both the theoretical and methodological bedrock of the field, guiding current studies and the development of new frameworks.\nSummary:\n- Pattern:\n- A small number of foundational works receive very high citation counts, while many other important references are cited at levels between 10 and 70. - The references encompass a broad range of disciplines, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of tourism research. - Interpretation:\n- High citation counts point to the enduring impact of seminal studies in shaping measurement, theory, and practice. - The diverse disciplinary sources underline how tourism research integrates insights from psychology, marketing, and management. - Overall:\n- These locally cited references form the backbone of the scholarly community, serving as key resources that inform research design, methodology, and theoretical development in tourism and hospitality studies.\ngt::gt(MostLocCitRefs %&gt;% filter(Citations &gt;= 10))\n(data/figure/MostLocCitRefs.png)\n\n\nReferences Spectroscopy\nWhen we talk about “References Spectroscopy” in the context of bibliometrics, we are drawing an analogy with the spectroscopic techniques used in the physical sciences to analyze materials based on the spectrum of the radiation they emit or absorb.\n\nReference Spectrum: Just as a material has a unique spectrum in physical spectroscopy, a research paper or topic will have a unique “spectrum” of references it cites. This spectrum can give insight into the foundational works for that paper or topic, indicating which previous works are most influential or relevant.\nAnalysis: By examining the “spectra” (or citation patterns) of multiple papers or topics, one can identify trends, clusters, and gaps in the research landscape. This is analogous to how one might use spectroscopy to categorize and analyze different materials based on their spectral signatures.\nEvolution Over Time: Just as the spectrum of a star can tell us about its age and stage in the lifecycle, looking at the changing citation patterns or “spectra” over time can reveal how a field or topic has evolved. It can show which works have become foundational over time or which ones have fallen out of favor.\nIntensity & Peaks: In physical spectroscopy, the intensity of certain peaks in a spectrum can indicate the concentration of specific elements or compounds. Similarly, in bibliometrics, certain references might be cited much more frequently than others, indicating their centrality or importance to the field. These “peaks” in the citation spectrum can point to seminal works or pivotal authors in a domain.\nComparative Analysis: By comparing the “spectra” of different papers, topics, or even researchers, one can identify overlaps, synergies, and distinctions. This can be useful for interdisciplinary research, collaboration opportunities, or understanding the landscape of a broad field.\nAnomalies & Outliers: Sometimes, a spectrum will have unexpected peaks or features. In bibliometrics, unexpected citation patterns might indicate emerging areas of interest, interdisciplinary bridges, or even issues like citation cartels or excessive self-citation.\nApplication: Just as spectroscopy has practical applications in material identification, quality control, and more, bibliometric “spectroscopy” can be used for research evaluation, funding allocation, curriculum design, and other academic or research management tasks.\n\nIn essence, the concept of “References Spectroscopy” in bibliometrics is a metaphorical way of describing the deep analysis of citation patterns to understand the structure, evolution, and dynamics of scholarly research.\nThe “Reference publication year spectroscopy” (RPYS) is a method to analyze the age of cited references in a given publication set. It can reveal the seminal works and foundational literature within a topic or domain. Let’s break down and interpret the given data on the bibliometric analysis:\n\nDescription\n\n\nTime Range and Citation Counts:\n\nThe data spans from as early as 1749 to 2025.\nFor each publication year, the table lists the number of citations received.\nTwo difference metrics are provided:\n\ndiffMedian5: The difference relative to a 5-year median.\ndiffMedian: The difference relative to an overall median.\n\n\nSpectral Peaks:\n\nSome years show very high citation counts (e.g., 1988: 772 citations; 1999: 1701 citations; 2000: 2151 citations; 2010: 4595 citations; 2017: 6451 citations; 2020: 7480 citations).\nThese peaks indicate years in which particularly influential works were published.\n\nRecent Years and Decline:\n\nAfter 2020, citation counts drop significantly (e.g., 2021: 5502; 2022: 3648; 2023: 2525; 2024: 1057; 2025: 39).\nThis decline is expected for very recent years since newer publications have had less time to be cited.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nFoundational Works and Seminal Years:\n\nThe peaks in certain years represent “spectral signatures” of foundational works in the field. For example:\n\n1988 Peak (772 citations, diffMedian = 316): Suggests that seminal contributions published in 1988 have become critical reference points.\nLate 1990s to Early 2000s Peaks (1701–2151 citations): Indicate a period of high impact research that likely shaped current theories and methodologies.\n2010 and Beyond: The strong peak in 2010 (4595 citations) and subsequent increases through 2017 (6451 citations) highlight a modern wave of influential work.\n\n\nEvolution Over Time:\n\nThe “spectrum” shows how the influential literature evolves:\n\nEarly periods (18th and 19th centuries) contribute sparsely.\nModern scholarship (late 20th century onward) provides a concentrated set of seminal works that dominate the citation landscape.\n\n\nIntensity and Anomalies:\n\nThe intensity (i.e., the height of the peaks) points to the centrality of key publications.\n\nAbrupt declines in very recent years are less a sign of diminishing quality than a reflection of citation lag—newer articles have not yet had sufficient time to accumulate citations.\n\nComparative and Trend Analysis:\n\nBy comparing the citation “spectra” across time intervals, one can identify periods of rapid development or paradigm shifts in the field.\nThe data can also be used to spot potential anomalies or emerging trends when unusual peaks or valleys appear.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nConclusion:\nReference Publication Year Spectroscopy provides a “spectral fingerprint” of a research field by mapping the age distribution of cited literature. The analysis reveals that certain years—often corresponding to seminal publications—dominate the citation landscape. Over time, these peaks mark periods of high impact and foundational contributions, while the recent decline reflects the natural citation lag for new works.\nSummary:\n- Data Pattern:\n- A wide temporal range with a few distinct peaks that highlight seminal publication years. - Difference metrics (diffMedian5 and diffMedian) help accentuate these peaks relative to typical citation levels.\n\nInterpretation:\n\nHigh citation peaks indicate the publication years of works that have become cornerstones of the field.\nThe evolution of the spectrum shows how foundational literature has accumulated over time, with recent years naturally showing lower counts due to citation lag.\n\nOverall Insight:\n\nRPYS is a powerful bibliometric tool that, by “spectroscoping” reference publication years, identifies the key historical contributions and tracks the evolution of scholarly influence within a discipline.\n\n\ngt::gt(RPYS[68941:69217, 1:4])\n(data/figure/RPYS.png)\n\n\n\n\nWords\n\nMost Frequent Words\nThe provided data lists the most relevant words and their occurrences in a bibliometric analysis related to the topic.\n\nDescription\n\n\nHigh-Frequency Terms:\n\nQuality-of-life (371 occurrences), satisfaction (326), and tourism (294) dominate the list. These high frequencies indicate that these topics are central to the research field.\nOther major terms include happiness (219), perceptions (204), attitudes (189), and impact (177).\n\nThematic Clusters:\n\nWell-Being and Quality: Words like quality-of-life, satisfaction, happiness, and life satisfaction suggest a strong focus on personal and communal well-being in the context of tourism.\nExperience and Behavior: The presence of terms such as experience, experiences, behavior, and behavioral intentions indicates an emphasis on how individuals experience tourism and the resulting behaviors.\nManagement and Service: Words like management, service quality, performance, and customer satisfaction highlight the operational and strategic side of tourism studies.\nSustainability and Community: Terms such as sustainable tourism, community, residents, destination, and conservation reflect the growing attention on environmental and social sustainability within the industry.\nMethodological and Theoretical Constructs: Other recurring words such as model, scale, pls-sem, and framework suggest the use of sophisticated methodological tools and theoretical frameworks in the literature.\n\nDistribution Characteristics:\n\nThe frequency distribution is highly skewed—a small number of key terms appear with very high frequency, while many terms cluster near the lower threshold (5–10 occurrences). This pattern is typical of bibliometric data and reflects the influence of Zipf’s law in language.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCentral Themes:\n\nQuality and Well-Being: The very high frequency of terms related to quality-of-life and satisfaction indicates that these concepts are the backbone of research in tourism and hospitality. Scholars are deeply invested in understanding how tourism affects personal and community well-being.\nExperiential and Behavioral Dimensions: Frequent use of terms such as experience, behavioral intentions, and perceptions underlines the importance of understanding both the subjective experiences of tourists and their subsequent behaviors.\nOperational Focus: Keywords such as management, service quality, and performance point to an emphasis on practical applications in tourism management, including improving service delivery and operational efficiency.\nSustainability and Social Impact: The appearance of sustainability-related terms (e.g., sustainable tourism, conservation, community participation) shows that environmental, social, and economic sustainability are critical issues being addressed in the field.\n\nMethodological Insights:\n\nThe presence of technical terms such as model, scale, and pls-sem suggests that advanced statistical and modeling techniques are widely applied in tourism research.\nThe spread of terms related to both qualitative (e.g., grounded theory, narratives) and quantitative (e.g., structural model, panel-data) methods indicates a mixed-methods approach in the literature.\n\nImplications for the Research Field:\n\nThe strong emphasis on quality-of-life, satisfaction, and experiential aspects implies that tourism research is not only concerned with economic outcomes but also with the social and psychological impacts of tourism.\nThe diversity of terms also highlights the interdisciplinary nature of the field, intersecting marketing, psychology, management, and sustainability studies.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nConclusion:\nThe word frequency analysis—our “word frequency spectroscopy”—reveals a dynamic and multifaceted research landscape. Central themes such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, and tourism experiences dominate the discourse, while a variety of supporting concepts (e.g., service quality, sustainability, behavioral intentions) underscore the field’s complexity and interdisciplinarity.\nSummary:\n- Pattern:\n- A few key terms appear very frequently, establishing the core focus of the literature. - The distribution follows a typical skewed pattern, with many terms clustering at lower frequencies. - Interpretation:\n- The prominence of well-being, experiential, and operational keywords signals that the field values both the subjective and objective aspects of tourism. - The methodological terms indicate robust, diverse approaches to researching these topics. - Overall Insight:\n- This “spectroscopy” of word frequencies helps identify the central pillars of the literature and guides researchers toward understanding the foundational themes, emerging trends, and interdisciplinary nature of tourism research.\nBy understanding these patterns, scholars and practitioners can better appreciate the evolution, current focus, and potential future directions of research in tourism and hospitality.\ngt::gt(MostFreqWords %&gt;% filter(Occurrences &gt;= 5))\n(data/figure/MostFreqWords.png)\n(data/figure/wordcloud.png)\n(data/figure/wordtreemap.png)\n\n\nWords’ Frequency over Time\nThe provided table offers a bibliometric analysis of the frequency of specific words related to the topic over a span of two decades.\n\nDescription\n\n\nGeneral Upward Trend:\nAcross all key terms, there is a clear and steady increase in frequency over time. Starting from minimal occurrences in the early 2000s (with many zeros in 2001–2002), the numbers gradually climb with notable acceleration in later years.\nTerm-Specific Observations:\n\nQuality-of-life:\nInitially absent or very low in frequency, this term shows exponential growth—rising to 371 occurrences by 2025.\nSatisfaction and Tourism:\nBoth terms follow a similar upward trend, indicating sustained and growing interest in these aspects.\nHappiness and Perceptions:\nThese terms start at modest levels but also experience significant increases, reflecting the growing focus on emotional and cognitive dimensions within tourism research.\nAttitudes and Impact:\nThe steady rise in these terms suggests that researchers increasingly consider how tourism influences both attitudes and measurable impacts.\nExperience, Health, and Model:\nAlthough starting lower compared to other terms, the frequency of these words also increases, underscoring an expanding emphasis on experiential, health-related, and methodological dimensions.\n\nNotable Increases:\nA marked increase is visible from 2012 onward, likely reflecting an expanding body of research and the maturation of the field, where more nuanced aspects (such as health, models, and experiential quality) are examined.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nEmerging and Evolving Themes:\nThe upward trajectory across all key terms indicates a growth in both the quantity and depth of research within the domain.\n\nQuality-of-life and satisfaction—core to understanding the impacts of tourism—have become focal points, reflecting a shift toward evaluating tourism’s effects on personal and community well-being.\nThe rise in tourism itself signals the overall expansion of the field.\nIncreased attention to happiness, perceptions, and attitudes suggests that the subjective experiences of tourists and residents are receiving more scholarly attention.\nThe growth in the frequency of model and related methodological terms highlights the increasing use of sophisticated analytical and statistical methods (e.g., structural equation modeling, pls-sem) to study these phenomena.\n\nMaturation of Research:\nThe consistent increase in these key words over time suggests that the field has matured. Early studies laid the foundation, and later research builds on these seminal works to explore more complex, multidimensional issues.\nReflecting Broader Trends:\nThe rise in terms like quality-of-life, health, and experience can be linked to broader societal trends—such as a focus on well-being, lifestyle, and the holistic impacts of tourism. Similarly, the use of methodological terms indicates that researchers are continuously improving the rigor and robustness of their analyses.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nConclusion:\nThe time-series data of word frequencies clearly illustrate the evolution of research themes in the tourism domain. As the field grows, core themes such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, and tourism have seen substantial increases in their usage. This not only reflects a quantitative growth in publications but also indicates a qualitative shift toward more comprehensive, multidisciplinary inquiries into the effects and implications of tourism.\nSummary:\n- Pattern:\n- There is an overall upward trend in the frequency of all key terms from 2001 to 2025. - Early years show very low frequencies, while later years demonstrate robust usage of terms. - Interpretation:\n- The increasing frequencies of terms like quality-of-life, satisfaction, tourism, and happiness suggest that these are central, evolving themes in the literature. - The growth in methodological and conceptual terms (e.g., model, experience) indicates an evolution toward more sophisticated research designs. - Overall Insight:\n- The data serve as a “spectroscopic” fingerprint of the field, revealing how foundational themes have grown and diversified over time. This evolution reflects both the expansion of tourism research and its increasing complexity, aligning with broader trends in societal focus on well-being, sustainability, and consumer experience.\nThis analysis of word frequency over time provides valuable insights into how the research landscape has developed and where future scholarly efforts may be directed.\ngt::gt(WordFreqOverTime)\n(data/figure/WordFreqOverTime.png)\n\n\nTrend Topics\n\nDescription\n\n\nWide Range of Topics:\nThe topics span from highly researched themes like quality-of-life, satisfaction, and tourism to more niche areas such as casino, connectedness, and social media.\nTemporal Distribution:\n\nEarlier Appearance: Some topics, like mood and patterns, show initial prominence around 2012–2013 with later median and Q3 years indicating continued relevance.\nLater Emergence: Key topics such as quality-of-life, perceptions, attitudes, satisfaction, tourism, and happiness have Q1 values around 2019–2020, with median and Q3 values extending to 2022–2024. This suggests these themes have become central and are driving recent research.\nSteady Themes: Other topics (e.g., leisure, vacation, social impacts) show a steady upward trend with their central tendency positioned in recent years.\n\nFrequency Variation:\n\nHigh-frequency topics (e.g., quality-of-life with 371 occurrences and satisfaction with 326) indicate major research drivers.\nLower-frequency topics (e.g., casino with 5 occurrences) may represent more specialized or emerging areas.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nEvolving Research Priorities:\nThe shift in the median and Q3 years toward the later part of the timeline for many key topics (such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, tourism, and happiness) suggests that the field has increasingly focused on the holistic and experiential aspects of tourism and its broader social and emotional impacts.\nEmergence of New Areas:\nTerms like social media and connectedness appear in the most recent quartiles, reflecting the impact of digital technologies and social networks on tourism research. Similarly, technology as a topic, though lower in frequency, is gaining traction in the later years.\nConsistent Themes:\nCore topics such as leisure, vacation, and travel have maintained consistent attention over the years, which indicates their foundational role in the research field. Their consistent appearance underscores the importance of understanding both the operational and experiential dimensions of tourism.\nImplications for Future Research:\nThe data suggest that while traditional topics remain critical, there is a growing interest in integrating digital and social dimensions (e.g., social media, connectedness) and exploring new angles on well-being (quality-of-life, self-determination) within the context of tourism and hospitality.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nConclusion:\nThe trend topics analysis reveals a clear evolution in research focus over the years. Traditional themes such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, tourism, and happiness have surged in importance in recent years, while emerging areas such as social media and connectedness signal the integration of digital dimensions into tourism research.\nSummary:\n- Pattern:\n- Many key terms have shifted toward later publication years, with medians and Q3 values in the 2020–2024 range. - High-frequency topics such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, and tourism dominate the recent landscape. - Interpretation:\n- The data indicate an evolving research focus from traditional tourism metrics to broader, more holistic measures of well-being and digital influence. - The steady rise of topics like leisure and vacation reinforces their enduring relevance. - Overall Insight:\n- The trend topics provide a “spectral” view of the field, highlighting both well-established and emerging themes. This evolution reflects the dynamic nature of tourism research as it adapts to societal changes, technological advancements, and new methodological approaches.\ngt::gt(TrendTopics)\n(data/figure/TrendTopics.png)"

    "text": "Clustering\n\nClustering by Coupling\nBibliometric coupling occurs when two documents reference a common third document in their bibliographies. It’s a method used to understand and visualize the intellectual structure of a scientific field.\n\nTable1 Parameters:\n\nAnalysis of Documents using the CR (Cited References) field.\nThe analysis uses a single word (ngram = 1) as a term.\nThe labeling term used is ‘ID’.\nThe impact measure is local, meaning the citation scores are specific to this dataset and do not refer to global scores.\nStemming is set to false, which means words in their base form were not merged (e.g., ‘running’, ‘runner’, and ‘ran’ are treated as distinct words).\nThe size of 0.3 might refer to the size of the nodes or clusters in a visualization (if one exists).\nCommunity repulsion and repel are both set to zero or false, which means there is no repulsion force in the clustering process. This could have implications for the layout of a network visualization.\nWalktrap is the clustering method used. Walktrap is a method that identifies communities (or clusters) in networks by simulating random walks.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThese parameters tell us that the bibliocoupling analysis focused on a set of 250 documents. Only references cited at least 7 times were considered, and the local citation impact was used to weigh the coupling. The walktrap clustering algorithm was chosen to detect communities (clusters) among documents.\nAll the documents in Table 2 are assigned to Cluster 1, indicating that—under the chosen coupling criteria—they share a similar citation footprint. The NormalizedLocalCitationScore gives an idea of each document’s local impact within this cluster. Higher scores (for example, above 5) may indicate that these works are central in this group, while lower scores indicate a more peripheral position.\nThe labels are created by extracting key words that most frequently appear within the coupled documents. For instance, in Cluster 1 the dominant topics appear to be “quality-of-life,” “satisfaction,” and “perceptions.” The “conf” values (for “confidence”) indicate the proportion with which these words characterize the cluster. In Cluster 2, terms such as “satisfaction,” “tourism,” and “happiness” define the group. The frequency (number of documents or occurrences), centrality (how central this cluster is within the network), and impact (aggregate local impact) help to compare the importance of each cluster. The color codes can be used to visually distinguish clusters in network visualizations.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCluster Formation:\n\nThe bibliocoupling analysis shows that a large portion of the 250 documents (as seen in Table 2) belong to a single dominant cluster (Cluster 1), suggesting a high degree of shared references among these works. The cluster is characterized by themes related to quality-of-life, satisfaction, and perceptions—a reflection of a common intellectual basis in tourism and hospitality research.\n\nCluster Labels and Themes:\n\nTable 3 provides a “spectral” overview of clusters by summarizing the key themes. Different clusters (here, four groups are shown) have distinctive profiles:\n\nGroups\n\nGroup 1: Emphasizes quality-of-life, satisfaction, and perceptions.\nGroup 2: Highlights satisfaction, tourism, and happiness.\nGroup 3: Focuses on tourism as well as quality-of-life and satisfaction (but with a different balance).\nGroup 4: Indicates a blend where quality-of-life and happiness are important alongside satisfaction.\n\nApplication: Such an analysis can help researchers identify the intellectual foundations of the field, pinpoint seminal works, and recognize the evolution of research topics over time. It also facilitates the discovery of potential gaps, emerging clusters, or the need for interdisciplinary bridges.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nIn summary, this bibliocoupling analysis—through document clustering—provides a detailed “map” of how research in tourism, quality-of-life, satisfaction, and related fields is interconnected. The parameters (Table 1) set the stage for the analysis, Table 2 shows the membership and impact of individual works within a cluster, and Table 3 synthesizes the thematic essence of each cluster, offering insights into the structure and evolution of the research landscape.\n(data/figure/CouplingMap1.png)\n(data/figure/CouplingMap2.png)"

    "text": "Conceptual Structure\n\nNetwork Approach\n\nCo-occurence Network\n\nDescription\n\n\nCluster 1:\n\nIncludes keywords such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, perceptions, attitudes, impact, support, management, destination, community, and so forth. These terms emphasize conceptual and socio-psychological aspects of tourism research (e.g., quality-of-life outcomes, satisfaction constructs, community support, and destination management).\n\nCluster 2:\n\nIncludes keywords such as tourism, happiness, experience, health, behavior, travel, leisure, motivation, vacation, hospitality, emotions, service quality, etc.\n\nThese terms tend to focus on traveler-centric topics such as tourist behavior, happiness, well-being, and experiential dimensions of tourism and hospitality.\nEach node is measured by three main centrality metrics:\n\nBetweenness: How often a keyword lies on the shortest path between two other keywords. High betweenness = strong “bridging” or “brokerage” role.\nCloseness: How close a keyword is to all other keywords in the network. High closeness = the keyword can quickly “reach” many others.\nPageRank: A measure of overall importance or influence in the network. High PageRank = a keyword is frequently linked or co-occurs with other influential terms.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCluster 1 Highlights\n\n\nQuality-of-life (Betweenness = 71.51, PageRank = 0.0720)\n\nThis has the highest betweenness and highest PageRank in the entire network, indicating it is a major “bridge” and a core concept.\nHigh betweenness means quality-of-life connects multiple subtopics, bridging them within tourism research.\nHigh PageRank underscores its frequent and influential co-occurrences with other key words like satisfaction, perceptions, and attitudes.\n\nSatisfaction (Betweenness = 61.36, PageRank = 0.0684)\n\nAnother highly central term, signifying it often co-occurs with quality-of-life and perceptions.\nIts role in bridging subtopics is second only to quality-of-life, reflecting the strong interplay between satisfaction constructs and broader tourism impacts.\n\nPerceptions (Betweenness = 22.47, PageRank = 0.0441) and Attitudes (Betweenness = 19.09, PageRank = 0.0420)\n\nBoth show moderate to high betweenness and are conceptually linked to how stakeholders (e.g., residents, tourists) perceive tourism’s impacts and outcomes.\nThey often appear in studies focusing on local community or tourist viewpoints.\n\nImpact / Impacts (Betweenness ~16, PageRank ~0.03)\n\nReiterates the thematic emphasis on understanding how tourism affects communities, well-being, and destination development.\n\nIn sum, Cluster 1 focuses on macro-level and conceptual themes such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, and stakeholder perceptions. The high bridging role of quality-of-life and satisfaction suggests these are pivotal, unifying concepts in tourism research.\n\n\nCluster 2 Highlights\n\n\nTourism (Betweenness = 29.29, PageRank = 0.0445) and Happiness (Betweenness = 28.09, PageRank = 0.0453)\n\nThese have the highest betweenness in Cluster 2, indicating they frequently link subtopics related to personal well-being, experiences, and behavior.\n\nExperience / Experiences (Betweenness ~14, PageRank ~0.0317) and Health (Betweenness ~8.62, PageRank ~0.0292)\n\nEmphasize the experiential and well-being dimensions of tourism.\nExperience is a core bridging term for traveler-centric research, while health underscores the growing interest in wellness, mental health, and stress recovery.\n\nBehavior (Betweenness = 5.54, PageRank = 0.0224), Travel (Betweenness = 3.64, PageRank = 0.0202), Leisure (Betweenness = 3.37, PageRank = 0.0205)\n\nReflect the micro-level, individual consumer or traveler perspective—motivation, behavior, and leisure patterns.\n\nHospitality, Service Quality, Loyalty, Customer Satisfaction\n\nThese terms highlight the hospitality management dimension within tourism, focusing on how service experiences influence consumer loyalty and satisfaction.\n\nOverall, Cluster 2 is more oriented toward traveler well-being, emotions, experiences, and behavioral outcomes (e.g., loyalty, motivation, and health benefits). Tourism and happiness stand out as bridging concepts linking different aspects of the tourist experience and personal well-being.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\n\nTwo Thematic Cores:\n\n\nCluster 1: Macro-level constructs—quality-of-life, satisfaction, and perceptions—dominate. They connect strongly with impacts, community, management, and destination themes.\nCluster 2: Micro-level or traveler-centric themes—tourism, happiness, experience, health, and behavior—are central, highlighting well-being, motivation, leisure, and service quality.\n\n\nMost Influential Terms:\n\n\nQuality-of-life leads in betweenness and PageRank, serving as a key integrative concept bridging other themes.\nSatisfaction, tourism, and happiness also show high centrality, indicating they frequently co-occur with many keywords and serve as important nodes in the network.\n\n\nConceptual Bridge:\n\n\nThe co-word network shows that quality-of-life (Cluster 1) and tourism / happiness (Cluster 2) are major “bridges,” connecting socio-psychological aspects (perceptions, attitudes, impacts) with personal experience dimensions (health, motivation, leisure).\n\n\nPractical Implication:\n\n\nResearchers focusing on policy and strategic planning may gravitate toward Cluster 1 concepts (e.g., quality-of-life, satisfaction, community impacts).\nScholars exploring traveler behavior, well-being, and experiential marketing will likely anchor in Cluster 2 (tourism, happiness, experience, health).\nConclusion:\n\nThe co-word network reveals two robust thematic poles in tourism research: one anchored in quality-of-life and satisfaction at the macro/community level, and the other in tourism, happiness, and health at the traveler experience level. High-betweenness terms (e.g., quality-of-life, satisfaction, tourism, happiness) serve as critical links across subfields, indicating these keywords are central to the ongoing dialogue in tourism and hospitality scholarship.\n\n\ngt::gt(CoWordNet)\n(data/figure/CoWordNet.png)\n\n\nThematic Map\nBased on the provided data, it appears to be a bibliometric analysis of the term. Bibliometric analysis is used to quantify and analyze published literature on a particular topic, often to identify the most prevalent themes, authors, and journals. The data seems to be organized in a thematic map, detailing the occurrences and relevance of certain words or terms associated with the topic.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Thematic Map positions each cluster according to two metrics:\nCallon Centrality: How important or “central” a cluster is to the entire research domain. High centrality indicates the cluster is well-connected and influences many other themes. Callon Density: How internally cohesive or “dense” a cluster is. High density indicates the cluster’s themes are well-developed and strongly interconnected. Additionally, the bubble size corresponds to the frequency of topics within that cluster (i.e., how often these topics appear in the dataset).\nFrom the table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster\nCallon Centrality\nCallon Density\nRank Centrality\nRank Density\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n2.91\n13.25\n3\n4\n1932\n\n\nSatisfaction\n5.24\n10.38\n4\n2\n3244\n\n\nPerceptions\n1.99\n10.76\n2\n3\n1461\n\n\nQuality-of-Life\n1.78\n9.51\n1\n1\n866\n\n\n\n\nCluster 1: Health has high density (13.25) but moderate centrality (2.91).\nCluster 2: Satisfaction stands out for having the highest centrality (5.24) and a relatively high density (10.38).\nCluster 3: Perceptions shows moderate centrality (1.99) and density (10.76).\nCluster 4: Quality-of-Life has lower centrality (1.78) and density (9.51), as well as the smallest frequency (866).\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nHealth\n\n\nDensity (13.25): Indicates a well-developed, cohesive set of themes.\nCentrality (2.91): The cluster is moderately influential within the overall research landscape.\nFrequency (1932): There is a substantial volume of research, covering:\n\nWell-being, mental health, stress, physical activity, wellness tourism, and vacation benefits.\nTopics such as positive psychology, life satisfaction, stress, self-determination, and burnout frequently appear.\n\nInterpretation: Although not the most central cluster, “Health” is deeply explored and internally cohesive. It serves as a significant subfield, possibly appealing to scholars studying tourism’s role in stress reduction, wellness experiences, and overall well-being.\n\n\nSatisfaction\n\n\nDensity (10.38): Well-developed but not as dense as “Health.”\nCentrality (5.24): The highest among all clusters, indicating it is a key bridging concept for the entire domain.\nFrequency (3244): The largest volume of research. Core themes include:\n\nConsumer behavior, service quality, tourism experience, loyalty, behavioral intentions, motivation, and hospitality management.\nThe presence of strong “experience” and “modeling” keywords indicates robust quantitative and conceptual frameworks analyzing satisfaction-related outcomes.\n\nInterpretation: “Satisfaction” is pivotal to the domain. It connects to many other themes (e.g., loyalty, experience, perceived value), making it a central hub in tourism and hospitality research.\n\n\nPerceptions\n\n\nDensity (10.76): Similar to “Satisfaction” in density, indicating strong internal links.\nCentrality (1.99): Somewhat lower centrality compared to “Satisfaction,” but not marginal.\nFrequency (1461): Moderately sized. Key themes:\n\nAttitudes, community perceptions, residents’ support, sustainable tourism, social impacts, and management aspects.\nEmphasis on how locals, communities, and stakeholders perceive tourism’s impacts.\n\nInterpretation: “Perceptions” focuses on stakeholder attitudes (especially residents), community-level impacts, and sustainability. Its moderate centrality suggests it is more specialized than “Satisfaction” but remains an important dimension of tourism research.\n\n\nQuality-of-Life\n\n\nDensity (9.51): The lowest density, indicating it is less internally cohesive compared to the others.\nCentrality (1.78): Also relatively low, meaning it is less connected to other clusters.\nFrequency (866): The smallest cluster, yet thematically crucial. Key topics:\n\nSocio-economic impacts, well-being research, policy aspects, urban tourism, and city contexts.\nTerms like “heritage,” “choice,” “innovation,” and “rural tourism” appear, suggesting a broad range but less internal overlap.\n\nInterpretation: “Quality-of-Life” is foundational to tourism’s broader socio-economic discourse, linking well-being to policy and development. Despite lower centrality and density, it remains a conceptually important area, especially for strategic and policy-driven studies.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\n\nHealth (high density, moderate centrality): A strongly developed cluster focusing on well-being, mental health, stress, and physical activity in tourism contexts.\nSatisfaction (highest centrality, well-developed density): The dominant cluster bridging various subfields in tourism and hospitality—centered on consumer satisfaction, loyalty, and experience.\nPerceptions (moderate centrality, moderate-high density): Focused on stakeholder attitudes, community impacts, and sustainability. Emphasizes how local communities and other stakeholders perceive tourism’s effects.\nQuality-of-Life (lowest centrality and density, smaller size): Addresses broader socio-economic outcomes, well-being research, and policy concerns, providing a more macro-level perspective on how tourism influences overall life quality.\nThe Satisfaction cluster emerges as the most central—meaning it touches many other areas of tourism research—while Health is the most internally cohesive (highest density). Perceptions occupies a mid-range position, suggesting it is well-studied but less of a “bridge” than Satisfaction. Quality-of-Life appears more specialized, with fewer interconnections but important for strategic policy insights.\nThe thematic analysis reveals four major research clusters in the field: Health, Satisfaction, Perceptions, and Quality-of-Life.\nSatisfaction is the key bridging concept in tourism and hospitality studies, connecting with consumer behavior, loyalty, service quality, and experience-driven research.\nHealth is a well-established, highly cohesive cluster focusing on wellness and well-being, indicating a strong niche of scholarship.\nPerceptions revolve around how stakeholders and communities view tourism, highlighting attitudes, community support, and sustainable tourism.\nQuality-of-Life stands out for exploring policy, socio-economic, and macro-level impacts, though it is less interconnected with other clusters.\nOverall, these four clusters collectively structure the tourism and hospitality research landscape, reflecting both micro-level topics (e.g., satisfaction, well-being) and macro-level considerations (e.g., community perceptions, quality-of-life, policy). Future research may benefit from integrating these clusters, for instance, examining how quality-of-life outcomes tie into satisfaction drivers, or how community perceptions intersect with health-related tourism experiences.\n\n(data/figure/ThematicMap.png)\n\n\n\n\nFactorial Approach\n\nFactorial Analysis\nFactorial analysis is a statistical method used to identify the underlying relationships among a set of variables. Here, you’ve presented data for words (probably representing research themes or keywords) and documents (probably representing research papers) in two different dimensions (Dim.1 and Dim.2).\n\nDescription\n\n\nIn our dataset, 50+ keywords (e.g., “quality.of.life”, “satisfaction”, “tourism”, “happiness”, “perceptions”, etc.) were subjected to a factor analysis. Two factors (here labeled Dim1 and Dim2) emerged that account for a major part of the variance in the keywords’ co-occurrence patterns. For example:\n\nQuality.of.life shows a strong negative loading on Dim1 (–0.85) and near zero on Dim2.\nAttitudes and perceptions both load very negatively on Dim1 (–1.63 and –1.15, respectively), while other terms such as support (–1.86) and sustainable.tourism (–1.87) are also strongly negative on Dim1.\nIn contrast, words such as vacation (1.05 on Dim1 and 1.16 on Dim2), health (0.81, 0.87), leisure (0.81, 0.97) and life (0.96, 0.17) show strong positive values—especially on Dim1.\nSome terms are more prominent on Dim2: for example, happiness (0.47, 0.58) and experiences (0.5, 0.69) suggest an important emotional/experiential component.\n\nEach keyword’s coordinates on these two dimensions is thought to reflect underlying “latent” factors in how topics are discussed in the literature.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nAlthough interpretation in factor analysis can be somewhat subjective, the pattern of loadings suggests the following:\n\nDimension 1: “Value & Appraisal versus Critical/Contextual Factors”\n\nHigh positive loadings (e.g., “vacation,” “life,” “health,” “leisure”) indicate terms that are typically associated with positive experiential outcomes and well‐being.\nHigh negative loadings (e.g., “perceptions,” “attitudes,” “support,” “sustainable.tourism”) indicate concepts that may capture evaluative or critical aspects (for example, community or stakeholder concerns, or constructs that question the status quo).\nIn essence, Dim1 appears to differentiate research that emphasizes the positive, beneficial, or “value‐adding” aspects of tourism from work that focuses on critical or challenging perspectives (or even on the underlying cognitive–affective appraisals of tourism impacts).\n\nDimension 2: “Emotional-Experiential Intensity versus Structural/Process Aspects”\n\nHigher scores on Dim2 (e.g., “happiness,” “experiences,” “leisure,” “benefits”) suggest a focus on the intensity of affect, emotion, or subjective experience.\nIn contrast, keywords such as “model,” “service.quality,” “behavioral.intentions,” and “loyalty”—which load more strongly in the negative direction on Dim2—may be more concerned with evaluative, outcome‐oriented, or structural aspects of tourism research.\nThus, Dim2 can be seen as contrasting research that emphasizes the affective, emotional, and experiential side of tourism versus work that is more about measurement models, process evaluations, and outcome indicators.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\n\nTwo key dimensions emerged from the factor analysis on tourism–related keywords.\n\nDimension 1 appears to capture a continuum from positive experiential and well–being aspects (e.g., “vacation,” “health,” “leisure,” “life”) to more evaluative or critical constructs (e.g., “attitudes,” “perceptions,” “support,” “sustainable.tourism”).\nDimension 2 seems to distinguish between emotionally charged, experiential concepts (e.g., “happiness,” “experiences”) and those keywords that are more process‐ or model–oriented (e.g., “model,” “behavioral.intentions,” “service.quality”).\nAll keywords included in this analysis were part of a single cluster (Cluster 1), indicating that while there is one overall thematic grouping in the literature, two latent dimensions underlie how these themes interrelate.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe factor analysis reveals that within tourism research the scholarly discourse can be understood along two interrelated axes. One axis (Dim1) differentiates between constructs related to positive outcomes and quality of life versus those that reflect critical perceptions and contextual challenges. The other axis (Dim2) highlights the distinction between the intensity of emotional and experiential aspects and more structural, model-based, or outcome–focused measures.\nThis dual‐dimensional structure underscores the multifaceted nature of tourism research. Researchers and practitioners can use these insights to:\n\nBetter understand which concepts are central to different research traditions (e.g., studies of well–being versus evaluations of tourism impacts).\nGuide future investigations by clarifying which aspects (emotional vs. structural, positive vs. critical) remain underexplored or in need of deeper theoretical integration.\nInform policy and management decisions by recognizing that both subjective well–being and structural performance indicators are critical in evaluating the success and sustainability of tourism initiatives.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the latent dimensions identified through the factor analysis provide a nuanced picture of how keywords cluster around themes of quality-of-life and satisfaction, while also highlighting the role of emotional experience versus evaluative modeling in tourism research. This enhanced understanding can help orient future research and interdisciplinary dialogue within the field.\n(data/figure/FactorialAnalysis1.png)\n(data/figure/FactorialAnalysis2.png)"

    "section": "Intellectual Structure",
    "text": "Intellectual Structure\n\nCo-citation Network\n\nDescription\n\nNetwork Structure and Clusters:\n\nCluster 1: This group includes documents such as Mccabe et al. (2013), Gilbert (2004), Smith (2017), Sirgy (2011), and several others. These works generally have moderate to low betweenness values (e.g., betweenness ranging from about 0.3 to 8) and closeness values around 0.012–0.015. Their PageRank scores (ranging roughly from 0.01 to 0.03) indicate that while they are cited together and contribute to a cohesive group, they are not the highest “bridging” documents in the network.\nCluster 2: Starting with nodes such as Kim K (2013), Andereck KL (2011), Woo E (2015), and others, Cluster 2 documents show very high betweenness values (e.g., 14–15 and even up to 27 in some cases) and relatively high closeness (around 0.014–0.017). Their PageRank scores (up to 0.036) indicate that these documents play a key role in linking various subfields or subtopics. This cluster likely represents a group of seminal or central works that many later studies reference together.\nCluster 3: The third cluster (which begins with Fornell (1981) and includes Uysal (2016), Hair (2010), Podsakoff (2003), etc.) has very high betweenness values (for instance, Fornell’s betweenness is over 130) and higher closeness values (around 0.017–0.019). Their PageRank scores are also higher (up to 0.03 or more). This cluster appears to capture highly influential and broadly recognized works that serve as intellectual hubs in the tourism literature.\n\nCentrality Measures:\n\nBetweenness Centrality: This measure reflects how often a document lies on the shortest path between other documents. Documents with high betweenness (e.g., those in Cluster 3) are considered “bridges” between different parts of the network, indicating they are crucial for connecting diverse research streams.\nCloseness Centrality: This value shows how close a document is to all other documents in the network. Most documents have closeness values in the narrow range (~0.012–0.019), suggesting that while there are differences, the network is relatively compact.\nPageRank: Higher PageRank values (e.g., those for some Cluster 3 documents) indicate that those papers are not only well‐cited but also cited by other well‐cited documents, underlining their broader influence within the literature.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nDistinct Intellectual Communities: The emergence of three clusters indicates that the field of tourism research is divided into at least three distinct intellectual communities or subfields. Each cluster groups together articles that tend to be cited together, suggesting that they share common themes or theoretical frameworks.\nInfluence and Bridging Roles: Documents in Cluster 3 (with very high betweenness and PageRank) appear to serve as key bridges, likely representing foundational or methodological works that have influenced multiple strands of tourism research. In contrast, Cluster 1 documents may be more specialized or represent a more coherent niche, while Cluster 2 contains influential works that are central to connecting topics within that niche.\nRole of Seminal Works: For instance, Fornell’s (1981) work in Cluster 3 has an exceptionally high betweenness centrality, marking it as a pivotal reference that links diverse research areas. Similarly, high betweenness scores in Cluster 2 (e.g., for Kim K (2013) and Andereck KL (2011)) suggest that these studies have had a substantial impact on subsequent research and are frequently co‐cited with a wide range of other documents.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe co‐citation network analysis reveals a structured landscape in tourism research where:\n\nCluster 1 comprises documents that form a specialized but cohesive group with moderate centrality values.\nCluster 2 consists of influential works that serve as important connectors within a subfield, having high betweenness and relatively high PageRank scores.\nCluster 3 includes seminal and widely influential documents that act as intellectual hubs, connecting diverse research streams across the field.\n\nConclusion: The network structure underscores the multidimensional nature of tourism research. High-centrality documents—particularly those in Cluster 3—are key for bridging theoretical, methodological, and empirical studies, thereby facilitating cross-fertilization between different research areas. In contrast, Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 represent more thematically coherent or specialized sub-communities. Recognizing these clusters and the roles of the central documents can guide researchers in identifying core literature, understanding the evolution of the field, and pinpointing potential areas for future interdisciplinary integration. This co‐citation analysis ultimately highlights both the diversity and the interconnectedness of scholarly work in tourism research.\ngt::gt(CoCitNet)\n(data/figure/CoCitNet.png)\n\n\nHistoriograph\n\nDescription\n\n\nCo-Citation Network In the co‑citation network, individual documents are represented as nodes and the frequency with which they are cited together forms the links between them. Key metrics—betweenness, closeness, and PageRank—help us gauge the influence and connectivity of each publication.\n\n\nClusters and Influential Works:\n\nThe network reveals several distinct clusters (in our sample, clusters “1”, “2”, and “3”) that represent different intellectual sub-communities within the literature. For example, documents such as Fornell (1981), Uysal (2016), and Hair (2010) in Cluster 3 have exceptionally high betweenness and PageRank scores. These works are central bridging documents that are not only well cited themselves but also frequently cited together with other influential studies. Their high betweenness indicates that they connect diverse parts of the network, suggesting that they serve as foundational references that have shaped multiple strands of research.\n\nCentrality Measures:\n\nBetweenness Centrality shows the role of a document as an intermediary between other works. Higher values (as seen with Fornell and Uysal) imply that these papers act as important conduits through which ideas and methods disseminate. Closeness Centrality indicates how near a document is to all others in the network, with most values clustering in a narrow band. This implies that, while differences exist, the network is relatively compact.\nPageRank reflects the overall “prestige” or influence of a paper. Documents with higher PageRank, particularly in Cluster 3, are influential in the sense that they are cited by other highly cited works.\nOverall, the co‑citation analysis suggests that seminal publications serve as intellectual hubs. They not only anchor their respective subfields but also bridge across them, facilitating the diffusion of ideas in the broader domain of tourism, quality of life, and well‑being research.\n\n\n\nFactorial Analysis on Keywords The factorial analysis on keywords investigates the underlying dimensions that organize the intellectual content of the field. In the provided table:\n\n\nDimensions (Factors):\n\nThe keywords have been projected onto two dimensions (Dim1 and Dim2) that capture patterns of co‑occurrence and semantic similarity across the literature. For instance:\nKeywords such as “quality.of.life”, “perceptions”, “attitudes”, “support”, “impacts” show strong negative loadings on the first dimension. This grouping may represent a critical or evaluative dimension in which the literature focuses on the challenges or complexities of assessing quality of life and subjective well‑being.\nIn contrast, keywords such as “happiness”, “health”, “experiences”, “leisure”, “benefits”, “vacation”, and “positive.psychology” tend to have positive loadings on the first and second dimensions. This pattern suggests a complementary perspective emphasizing the positive and experiential aspects of tourism and its contribution to well‑being.\n\nThematic Grouping:\n\nThe factorial solution appears to cluster together terms that reflect both the evaluative (e.g., perceptions, attitudes, and negative aspects like stress or constraints) and the experiential (e.g., happiness, health, leisure, and benefits) sides of the literature. This dual structure underscores the multidimensionality of research in tourism: while some works scrutinize the challenges and potential negative impacts (or the critical evaluation of quality-of-life metrics), others highlight the positive outcomes and benefits that travel and leisure experiences can offer.\n\nDocument Contributions:\n\nA complementary analysis of documents (Table 2) shows how individual papers load on these dimensions. Papers with strong positive contributions might represent research that emphasizes the uplifting and beneficial outcomes of travel experiences, whereas those with negative loadings may address challenges, limitations, or areas for improvement in assessing tourism’s impact on quality of life.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe combined analyses reveal a rich, interconnected intellectual landscape in tourism and well‑being research:\n\nCo‑citation Network:\n\nThe network structure, through its clusters and centrality measures, indicates that the field is anchored by several seminal works—especially in Cluster 3—that serve as critical hubs linking diverse research streams. These influential documents act as bridges, disseminating ideas across the field and underpinning both methodological and conceptual advances. Meanwhile, other clusters represent more specialized thematic groups that address specific aspects of tourism’s impact on quality of life.\n\nFactorial Analysis on Keywords:\n\nThe keyword analysis uncovers two main dimensions that represent opposing yet complementary perspectives. One dimension is characterized by critical evaluative terms (such as negative perceptions, stress, or constraints) while the other highlights the positive, experiential outcomes (including happiness, health, leisure, and benefits). This duality reflects the inherent complexity of tourism research, where studies balance assessments of both the challenges and the enriching aspects of travel experiences.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTaken together, these analyses demonstrate that tourism research is multifaceted—both in its intellectual structure and in its thematic content. The co‑citation network identifies key publications that have significantly influenced the field and act as linchpins connecting various research areas. Simultaneously, the factorial analysis of keywords reveals a nuanced interplay between critical evaluation and the celebration of positive experiences. Recognizing these patterns can help researchers, practitioners, and policymakers better understand the evolution of the field, identify core literature and emerging trends, and foster further interdisciplinary integration. This comprehensive insight supports more informed decisions in research direction, policy formulation, and the practical application of tourism and well‑being studies.\n\n\ngt::gt(Historiograph)\n(data/figure/Historiograph.png)"

    "text": "Social Structure\n\nCollaboration Network\nThe given data presents a bibliometric analysis of the author collaboration network on the topic. The metrics included are betweenness, closeness, and PageRank. Let’s delve into an interpretation of the results:\n\nDescription\n\nThe collaboration network represents how authors are connected through co‑authorship relationships. Each node is an individual researcher, and the network is partitioned into several clusters (labeled here by numbers). In this dataset, nodes are characterized by several centrality measures:\n\nBetweenness Centrality: Indicates an author’s role as a “bridge” or connector between otherwise separate parts of the network. High betweenness suggests that an author plays a key role in linking different collaboration groups.\nCloseness Centrality: Reflects how “close” an author is to all other authors in the network. A higher closeness value means that the author is well‑positioned to quickly interact or share information with others.\nPageRank: Captures the overall “influence” or prestige of the author within the network, taking into account not only the number but also the importance of collaborators.\n\nThe network is divided into several clusters (e.g., Cluster 1, Cluster 2, Cluster 3, etc.), suggesting that researchers tend to collaborate within certain groups. For example, Cluster 1 includes nodes like Zhang Y, Gao J, Lee TJ, and Chen CC, while Cluster 2 is characterized by authors such as Kim S, Lee CK, Han H, and Ramkissoon H.\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nKey Connectors and Influencers:\n\n\nZhang Y (Cluster 1) shows the highest betweenness in its cluster (≈72.67), which means that this author often serves as a bridge between otherwise disconnected groups. In addition, a high PageRank (≈0.0346) further underscores Zhang Y’s influential position.\nIn Cluster 2, authors like Kim S, Lee CK, Han H, and Ramkissoon H also have high betweenness values and relatively high closeness scores, indicating that this group is not only tightly knit but also well connected to other parts of the network.\nUysal M in Cluster 10 stands out with a high betweenness of about 74.31 and an impressive PageRank of nearly 0.06, suggesting that Uysal is a central figure in a distinct collaboration sub‑community, acting as both a hub and a bridge to other groups.\n\n\nCluster Characteristics:\n\n\nClusters 1 and 2 appear to be the most densely interconnected, with multiple nodes exhibiting similar closeness and PageRank values. These clusters likely represent established research groups or long‑standing collaborative networks in the field.\nClusters with lower node counts or with nodes showing very low betweenness (for example, some nodes in Clusters 4 or 5 where betweenness is 0) may represent peripheral groups or newer collaborations that are not yet well integrated into the broader network.\n\n\nOverall Connectivity:\n\n\nThe variation in closeness centrality (ranging roughly from 0.005 to 0.012 in most cases) suggests that, on average, authors are not very “distant” from each other—indicating a relatively compact network structure. This compactness can facilitate the rapid dissemination of ideas and collaborative practices across the field.\nPageRank scores, although varying, help identify which authors are cited or recognized frequently by other influential authors. For instance, Uysal M’s relatively high PageRank in Cluster 10 is indicative of his significant impact within that sub-community.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe collaboration network reveals a multi‑cluster structure, highlighting both well‑established research groups and more peripheral or emerging clusters. Key authors such as Zhang Y (Cluster 1), Kim S (Cluster 2), and Uysal M (Cluster 10) act as critical connectors and influencers within their groups. High betweenness and PageRank values for these nodes indicate that they not only facilitate collaborations within their own clusters but also serve as bridges to other parts of the network. Closeness centrality values show that most authors are relatively near to one another in terms of collaborative reach, reinforcing the notion of a densely interconnected research community.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe analysis of the collaboration network provides valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of research collaboration in this domain. Key findings include:\n\nThe presence of distinct collaboration clusters, each with its own set of influential authors.\nSeveral central figures (high betweenness and PageRank) play pivotal roles in connecting disparate groups, suggesting that fostering collaborations with these individuals could enhance interdisciplinary and cross‑cluster research.\nThe relatively compact nature of the network implies that innovations and methodological advancements can spread rapidly through these collaborations.\n\n\n\nOverall, the collaboration network reflects a vibrant and interconnected research community. By identifying the key players and understanding the collaborative structure, researchers and decision‑makers can better design strategies for knowledge sharing, resource allocation, and the promotion of interdisciplinary studies.\ngt::gt(CollabNet[25:70,1:4])\n(data/figure/CollabNet.png)\n\n\nCountries’ Collaboration World Map\nThe dataset offers a broad view of the collaborations between countries in the field. The frequencies indicate the number of times scholars from two countries have co-authored papers. In this case, the majority of collaborations have a frequency of 1, meaning that many pairs of countries have collaborated once.\n\nDescription\n\n\nHigh-Frequency Links\n\n\nChina → USA (91 collaborations) is by far the most frequently observed connection, indicating a very strong research or project link between these two countries.\nChina → Australia (65) and Australia → United Kingdom (14) also stand out, suggesting that these triads (China–USA, China–Australia, and Australia–UK) form a major hub of collaboration.\nThe United Kingdom → South Africa (15) and Australia → South Africa (11) links highlight substantial ties between parts of Europe, Oceania, and Africa.\n\n\nRegional Clusters\n\n\nThe table shows many intra-Asia or Asia–Pacific collaborations: for instance, Australia with various Asia-Pacific nations (e.g., Malaysia, New Zealand, Korea) and China with countries like Korea, Malaysia, and Japan.\nThere are also strong Europe-based clusters. For instance, Finland has multiple connections to Germany, Sweden, Estonia, etc., and Spain has multiple links across Europe (Portugal, France, Germany, etc.).\n\n\nNorth–South Collaborations\n\n\nThe data indicates many cross-hemisphere partnerships, such as: USA collaborating with countries in Africa (South Africa, Ghana, Egypt) and Latin America (Mexico, Chile).\nUnited Kingdom partnering with countries in Asia (India, Malaysia, Thailand), the Middle East (Oman, Saudi Arabia), and Africa (South Africa, Ghana).\n\n\nNotable Emerging Collaborations\n\n\nSome countries that might not be as frequently highlighted in global research contexts appear here with multiple ties, e.g., Pakistan, Oman, and Rwanda, each collaborating with various countries.\nCountries such as Vietnam and Indonesia show collaborations across multiple continents, including Europe, Asia, and Oceania.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nMajor Global Hubs\n\nUSA, China, Australia, and the United Kingdom appear to be central hubs in this network. They have numerous high-frequency links spanning different continents, suggesting a broad international footprint in collaborative work.\n\nStrong Asia–Pacific Ties\n\nCollaboration among China, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, and others in this region is robust. This reflects a well-connected research environment in the Asia–Pacific.\n\nEurope’s Multiple Clusters\n\nMany European countries (e.g., Finland, Germany, Spain, Portugal) have wide-reaching collaborations both within Europe and internationally (Latin America, Africa, and Asia).\n\nAfrica’s Rising Presence\n\nSouth Africa stands out as a key collaborator in Africa, linking with the UK, USA, Malaysia, Norway, and more. There are also smaller but noteworthy collaborations involving countries like Ghana, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Mauritius.\n\nOpportunities for New Links\n\nWhile some country pairs show strong existing collaboration, others appear only once, indicating potential for expansion. Low-frequency edges might be starting points for growing cross-national research partnerships.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\n\nThis collaboration dataset reveals a complex, global network of partnerships. Certain countries, such as China, USA, Australia, and the United Kingdom, dominate with many high-frequency collaborations. Regions like Asia–Pacific and Europe show strong intra-regional and inter-regional links, while African and Latin American countries also appear as strategic partners in multiple contexts.\nOverall, the data underscores the highly interconnected nature of global research and project collaborations. It can guide future policy decisions, research funding, and institution-level strategies aiming to foster international partnerships and bridge any existing gaps in the global network.\n\ngt::gt(CollabWorldMap %&gt;% filter(Frequency &gt;= 3))\n(data/figure/CollabWorldMap.png)"

    "title": "Bibliometrics Analysis Report",
    "section": "Discussion of the bibliometrics",
    "text": "Discussion of the bibliometrics\nThe analysis report (Chae, 2025a) offers a comprehensive bibliometric examination of the literature on tourists’ experiences and happiness. It employs performance indicators, co-citation analyses, and thematic mappings to reveal publication trends, identify influential authors and journals, and elucidate the conceptual and intellectual structures that define this research domain. Overall, it shows an initial, gradual increase in publications in the early 2000s, followed by a sharp rise in recent years, signaling widespread scholarly and societal interest in how tourism intersects with well-being. Older publications consistently demonstrate higher citation counts, reflecting their foundational impact. Key journals such as Tourism Management, Journal of Travel Research, and Journal of Sustainable Tourism play a central role in disseminating significant findings, while researchers like Uysal, Filep, and Kim appear repeatedly as leading figures, suggesting a concentration of expertise and influence. The analysis also highlights extensive international collaboration—spanning China, the United States, and Australia—underscoring the global scope of tourism research and the multifaceted ways it addresses quality of life, subjective well-being, and holistic travel experiences. Two principal thematic clusters emerge. One focuses on macro-level constructs such as quality of life, community impacts, and satisfaction, while the other centers on micro-level, traveler-centric themes such as health, happiness, and experiential outcomes. Factor analysis adds nuance to these findings, indicating that hedonic (pleasure-oriented) and eudaimonic (meaning-oriented) perspectives both occupy prominent positions in scholarly discussions of tourist well-being.\n\nRelevant Arguments Findings shows emphasizing the need to move beyond tourism’s economic or recreational aspects and to integrate subjective well-being and life satisfaction into the scholarly lens. The proposal advocates a holistic, interdisciplinary framework that brings together psychology, economics, sociology, and management to study hedonic and eudaimonic aspects. Similarly, the analysis report indicates that tourism studies are increasingly investigating subjective constructs such as quality of life, satisfaction, and happiness, although these efforts sometimes remain fragmented and isolated. Both sources suggest that comprehensive research on tourism and happiness has the potential to shape more robust policies, industry practices, and cross-disciplinary collaborations that can improve overall quality of life for travelers and host communities.\nResearch Questions and Finidngs\n\nRQ1: Do Tourism Experiences Enhance Subjective Well-Being? The proposal posits that tourism positively influences subjective well-being, asserting that travel boosts happiness and life satisfaction. The analysis report (Chae, 2025a) confirms that many studies document heightened happiness around trips, a phenomenon sometimes termed the “vacation effect.” It does, however, highlight that this uplift may be short-lived, with happiness levels eventually reverting to baseline. Nonetheless, it also notes that certain meaningful or “eudaimonic” travel experiences can create deeper and longer-lasting gains. These findings validate the proposal’s fundamental assumption about a positive tourism–happiness link but also stress that duration and intensity of the benefit depend on how and why people travel.\nRQ2: Which Factors in Tourism Experiences Most Influence Happiness? The proposal underscores factors like destination quality, enjoyment, and safety as primary drivers of tourist happiness. In alignment with this view, the bibliometric analysis pinpoints environmental quality, destination image, risk perception, and authenticity of the travel experience as central to well-being (Chae, 2025a). Overcrowding is identified as a negative influence, especially under conditions of overtourism. In addition, the discussion of safety—particularly in light of global health events—underscores the importance of contextual variables. These observations reinforce the proposal’s argument while broadening its scope: beyond mere enjoyment or good service, factors like social environment and health-related safeguards are indispensable for ensuring a truly satisfying trip.\nRQ3: How Do Scholars Conceptualize and Measure Tourist Happiness? The proposal suggests a positive-psychology framework incorporating both hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions. The analysis report (Chae, 2025a) shows that the field largely adopts Diener’s (1984) Subjective Well-Being constructs, blending positive affect, negative affect, and cognitive life satisfaction. Measures such as the Life Satisfaction Scale frequently appear, reflecting a primarily subjective, survey-based methodology. Many researchers also explore deeper, purpose-driven experiences, thus affirming the proposal’s view that happiness is more than a fleeting emotion; rather, it can involve personal growth and meaning. These findings confirm that tourism scholars prioritize psychological scales and models of well-being, lending empirical support to the proposal’s approach.\nRQ4: What Are the Major Research Gaps and Future Directions? The proposal argues that tourism-happiness research remains fragmented and requires interdisciplinary integration. The bibliometric analysis confirms this fragmentation while identifying trends such as sustainability, technology-driven experiences, and global risk factors (Chae, 2025a). Sustainability issues appear increasingly central, as do the psychological and behavioral effects of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging questions also concern digital tourism and how online platforms can shape or mediate tourist well-being. These gaps and emerging foci echo the proposal’s call for an integrative framework that spans economics, sociology, public health, and psychology. The analysis thereby extends the proposal’s recommendations by highlighting specific under-studied domains—particularly the long-term psychological consequences of travel disruptions and the evolving influence of virtual reality on tourist experiences.\n\n\n\nDiscussio Points\n\nRelevant Arguments: Both documents assert that tourism goes well beyond its traditional role as a recreational or economic activity. The analysis report demonstrates—with extensive performance, network, and thematic mapping analyses—that research in tourism is increasingly concerned with how travel experiences shape subjective well-being, quality of life, and overall happiness. In parallel, the proposal argues that the field remains fragmented, with isolated studies examining hedonic (pleasure-focused) versus eudaimonic (meaning-focused) aspects. Together, they build a case for a more holistic understanding of tourism’s multifaceted impact on human well-being. This perspective is essential as it calls for integrating both psychological and socio-economic dimensions to inform policy, practice, and further academic inquiry.\n\n\nPotential Research Questions: Drawing on the identified gaps and emerging trends, several research questions naturally arise: • How do distinct travel experiences differentially influence hedonic and eudaimonic well-being? • What psychological mechanisms mediate the relationship between tourism and overall quality of life? • In what ways do demographic, cultural, and digital factors (e.g., the role of virtual reality) moderate the impact of tourism on happiness? • How can integrated bibliometric and qualitative methodologies further refine our understanding of the evolving intellectual structure in tourism research?\n\n\nInterdisciplinary Implications: Both documents highlight the inherently interdisciplinary nature of studying tourism and happiness. By merging perspectives from positive psychology, economics, sociology, and management, the research field is poised to develop richer, more nuanced models of well-being. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances theoretical development but also offers practical benefits for policymakers and industry stakeholders. For example, insights from the analysis report—through network and factorial analyses—show how diverse academic traditions intersect, suggesting that collaboration across fields can drive innovations in both tourism experience design and well-being enhancement.\n\n\nMethodological Challenges and Innovations: A recurring theme is the challenge of synthesizing a fragmented literature that spans multiple disciplines and employs varied methodologies. One of the main challenges is operationalizing subjective constructs like happiness and well-being in a standardized and comparable way. On the innovation front, the proposal advocates for a combination of bibliometric methods, qualitative content analysis, and machine-learning techniques (such as structural topic modeling) to map research trends and uncover latent intellectual structures. The analysis report further demonstrates how network analyses (co-citation, bibliographic coupling) and factorial analyses can reveal the underpinnings of tourism research. These methodological innovations not only help in capturing complex interrelations but also pave the way for more robust, data-driven evaluations of how tourism contributes to happiness."

    "section": "Conclusion of the bibliometrics analysis",
    "text": "Conclusion of the bibliometrics analysis\n\nThe bibliometric analysis report and the research proposal collectively illuminate a maturing yet still evolving scholarly landscape. A core consensus emerges that tourism experiences do, in fact, enhance happiness, albeit through varying degrees of hedonic and eudaimonic pathways. The field’s conceptual and methodological foundations rest upon well-established positive-psychology measures, although new lines of inquiry—such as sustainability, risk perception, and digital transformation—point to a broader, interdisciplinary perspective. Both documents underscore the importance of situating tourism within a more holistic, life-satisfaction context that accounts for cultural, social, and psychological complexities. The analysis confirms the proposal’s argument that tourism research now recognizes human well-being as a crucial outcome of travel experiences, but it also reveals areas where research remains patchy, calling for innovative, data-driven methods and collaborative theoretical models. By uniting insights from the proposal’s theoretical roadmap with the analysis report’s empirical mapping, scholars and practitioners can more effectively harness tourism’s potential to foster and sustain human happiness in a rapidly changing global environment.\nIn conclusion, findings converge on the need for a comprehensive, integrative approach to studying the relationship between tourism and happiness. The relevant arguments call for moving beyond narrow, isolated studies toward a multidimensional framework that accounts for both immediate and lasting impacts on well-being. Future research should address the proposed questions, embrace interdisciplinary methodologies, and overcome challenges related to data standardization and integration. Together, these efforts can deepen our understanding of tourism’s transformative potential for enhancing quality of life, guiding both academic research and practical interventions in the tourism industry."

    "text": "Purpose of Research\nOver the course of recent years, we have executed eight qualitative investigations focusing on female leadership in South Korea, employing semi-structured interviews as our primary data collection modality. The compilation of data encompasses 200 interviews accumulated from these qualitative inquiries. As a progression in our analytical methodology, we intend to reevaluate the amassed interview data through the implementation of topic modeling techniques. This sophisticated analytical approach will facilitate the identification of potentially overlooked research subjects and thematic elements that may not have been captured through the exclusive employment of qualitative research methods."

    "section": "Analytic Procedure",
    "text": "Analytic Procedure\n\nThe dataset, comprising 200 interview transcripts, will be subjected to anonymization, followed by the creation of ancillary metadata encompassing interviewee identifiers (ranging from 2015-1 to 2022-50), industrial affiliations, designations, tenure, familial composition, and support structures. This anonymized metadata will be instrumental in discerning demographic-based patterns pertaining to female leadership.\nPreliminarily, the topic modeling methodology will be deployed on a representative subset of the interview transcripts to ascertain its congruence with the data. In instances of informational lacunae within the metadata, deliberations will ensue on strategies to address such discrepancies before proceeding.\nUpon attaining consensus, the topic modeling methodology will be systematically applied to the entire dataset, utilizing computational methodologies delineated in the ensuing data analysis schema.\nAs the computational outcomes materialize, an interdisciplinary consortium of researchers will embark on an evaluative discourse concerning the validity and reliability of the topic modeling outcomes. This analysis will entail juxtaposition against findings from the eight antecedent studies. The validation process will engage five researchers involved in previous qualitative investigations and two external scholars. The objective is to unearth latent research themes concerning female leadership in South Korea, harnessing the computational acuity of topic modeling to supplement the qualitative analysis. This amalgamation of computational and interpretative approaches is anticipated to yield unbiased, robust, and reproducible research themes, thereby catalyzing future scholarly exploration and pragmatic applications.\n\nThe data analysis protocol is bifurcated into four cardinal stages: data assimilation and reformatting, data purification, preprocessing, and modeling. Initially, the 200 transcripts will undergo conversion to textual files and subsequently be structured into data frames within an Excel environment. This structure will demarcate interview questions, responses, and anonymized metadata. The second phase encompasses data cleansing, during which data validation is performed to ensure type fidelity and to ascertain the presence of any voids in the dataset. The preprocessing phase, which distinguishes text mining from traditional qualitative and quantitative analyses, involves transforming the text into an analyzable corpus. Techniques such as n-gram generation, stop-word filtering, and part-of-speech tagging are employed to construct tokenized word lists. Finally, structured topic modeling (STM) based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is applied to the processed data, yielding a matrix of topics and their associated probabilities. The model also affords criteria for the optimization of the number of topics. The research consortium will then undertake the responsibility of ascribing semantic labels to the topics, predicated upon keyword co-occurrence patterns."

By applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we were able to exclude 14 items, which consisted of 5 book reviews, 6 editorial materials, 1 letter, 1 book review early access, and 1 editorial material early access. Consequently, we were left with 159 research articles, which accounted for approximately 79% of the total articles, 13% of the early access articles, 9% of the reviews, and 3% of the early access reviews. These articles primarily consisted of publications in the form of articles and reviews.\n\n\n9\neditor\nDetail the process of article selection, including inclusion/exclusion criteria and rounds of selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n10\neditor\nSpecify the steps taken in each round for article selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nA figure explain search term evaluation procedure added\nfigure1\n\n\n11\neditor\nYou may move the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section to the method section with a different title because it is as if you described the sample.\nAnalytics\nRevise\nMove to method section\nNA\nNA\napplied\nWhole section moved under method\n\n\n12\neditor\nIn addition, consider condensing the description in this section.

This means that our search specifically targeted literature written in the English language.\nFirst, we started a preliminary search using seed keywords related to analytics, assessments, and measurement of people in organizational contexts that written in English.\n\n\n15\neditor\nProvide the number of articles related to each topic identified\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nThe LDA/STM topic model is a useful tool for uncovering hidden topics within articles by utilizing probability calculations. It determines the likelihood of multiple dominant topics appearing in an article and calculates the probability of each identified topic occurring throughout the article. However, it is currently not feasible to accurately determine the exact number of articles related to each specific topic. In the best-case scenario, we can potentially provide suggestions regarding the top five dominant topics per article or identify the dominant topic that exceeds a certain occurrence probability threshold. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the distribution of probabilities for some topics may be heavily skewed. Furthermore, there is no widely agreed-upon consensus or established method for determining the appropriate threshold level to apply in these suggestions.\nNA\n\n\n16\neditor\nInclude a measure of purity for the clustering model\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nPurity measures, which are commonly used in supervised machine learning approaches with benchmark datasets, typically rely on mutual information. These measures are particularly employed in tree regression and clustering methods. However, when it comes to hierarchical clustering, which is a distance-based clustering approach, purity measures are not commonly utilized. Instead, other evaluation measures such as the elbow method, average silhouette method, and gap statistic method are considered more suitable for assessing hierarchical clustering. Additionally, no bibliometrics study to date has reported on the usage of these evaluation measures. Therefore, in addition to considering the characteristics of the special issue and journal, there arises a question as to whether we should include information about these evaluation methods and their corresponding processes in our report.\nNA\n\n\n17\neditor\nExplain how centrality and impact of clusters were measured and specify the centrality metrics used\nAnalytics\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd explanation in note for the figure\nThe x-axis represents the cluster centrality, which is measured using Callon's Centrality index. On the other hand, the y-axis represents the cluster impact, which is measured using the Mean Normalized Local Citation Score (MNLCS). The Normalized Local Citation Score (NLCS) of a document is determined by dividing the actual count of citations from local sources by the expected citation rate for documents published in the same year. This calculation allows for a fair comparison of citation impact across different documents, accounting for the varying expected citation rates based on the publication year.\nNA\n\n\n18\neditor\nClarify the reasons for selecting topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd contents about why we applied three method\nWhen conducting a scoping review, topic modeling, bibliocoupling, and hierarchical clustering are essential techniques, each providing a unique lens to comprehend and organize a large body of literature. Topic modeling, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is a statistical model that identifies the \"topics\" of a collection of documents. In the context of a scoping review, it is crucial to distinguish the predominant themes across the selected literature. Typically, a scoping review aims to assess the scope and depth of the existing literature on a specific topic. Utilizing topic modeling, researchers can efficiently highlight key themes and trends. Bibliocoupling, which assesses the relatedness between articles based on their shared references, complements topic modeling. This technique enables researchers to identify clusters of closely related articles, which they can then analyze to determine the subtopics or themes they represent. By identifying segments of literature that share references during a scoping review, researchers can infer that these groups may be addressing similar research questions or topics, thereby establishing a deeper level of comprehension. Hierarchical clustering offers a way to organize the identified themes or topics visually. As a type of cluster analysis, it seeks to construct a hierarchy of clusters by providing a visual representation, such as a dendrogram, of the relationships between various research themes. By employing this methodology, researchers can comprehend the intricate relationships between various fields of study and identify overarching themes or trends. Consequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature. With topic modeling illuminating key themes, bibliocoupling demonstrating the relationship between various articles, and hierarchical clustering visually representing the relationship between themes, researchers can gain an in-depth comprehension of the current state of research in a particular field. Combining these techniques provides an integrative method for comprehending the nuances and particulars of a particular field of study.\nNA\n\n\n19\neditor\nExplain whether these analyses are complementary or convergent\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nexplained in issue ID 18\nConsequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature.

You have 20 topics that are grouped into four themes as well as 7 clusters. What do they do for HRD practice and research? There seems to be a lack of justification for having both.

However, it is difficult to envision how the findings can be useful for HRD practice. Although you discussed some implications for HRD practice, the core content is not based on the main findings. This is a critical challenge.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n26\neditor\nCreate the limitations section and address limitations along with its delimitation and methodological limitations\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n27\neditor\nSplit the “Implications for Future Research and Practice” section into “Implications for HRD Research,” “Implications for HRD Practice,” “Study Limitations,” and “Recommendations for Future Research.”\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n28\neditor\nYou proposed what PA should focus on. Please make it clear that your proposal is based on the findings and sufficiently covers the scope of HRD. Organizational effectiveness or organization development-related domains seem to be missing. This leads us to believe that perhaps leaving out the definitions of PA might be necessary.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n29\neditor\nWhy do you need the definitions along with the new one to achieve the purpose of this study? How is it relevant to the research purpose or the RQs? You might need to introduce some of them in the introduction section in a concise manner.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n30\neditor\nAddress APA format issues as Reviewer 1 raised.

However, the introduction section fails to effectively narrow down the research focus and establish a compelling problem statement for conducting this research in the field of HRD. ~~ However, the third paragraph (from Line 51-55 on Page 1 to Line 3-27 on Page 2) introduces diverse while disconnected points. It starts by removing the context and addressing concerns mainly about PA, then introduces different terms related to PA and argues for the need to clarify the definition of PA. This need, though, is not directly tied to the research question but is later addressed in the discussion section. The third paragraph concludes by mentioning increasing emphasis of PA in “HRM.” The context switch is indeed abrupt and disrupts the logical flow of the text. I suggest that the author reorganize these points to develop a coherent logical flow and frame a compelling problem statement specifically situated in the field of HRD.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n33\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the fourth paragraph (Line 29-50, Page 2) in the introduction section repeats the concerns and challenges of PA, circling back to the initial point in the third paragraph.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n34\nreviewer1\nFurthermore, on Page 2, Lines 3-6, it is stated, \"Despite these concerns, the PA scholar community has established some consensus about terms and methods.\" However, the statement is followed by a list of different PA-related terms while did not exemplify any PA methods. I recommend that the authors cite Yoon (2018, 2021) as mentioned in the second paragraph to provide examples of common PA methods to provide supporting information to the statement.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n35\nreviewer1\nIn the last paragraph of the introduction section, there is a limited discussion of the methods employed. I recommend that the authors develop a standalone method section to provide more detailed explanations of the methods used in the study. This will enable readers to understand how the measures were computed, interpret the reported matrices, and comprehend how the study arrived at its findings.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n36\nreviewer1\nIn Line 34-35, Page 5, it is stated, \"After the third round, a total of 173 articles were retrieved.\" However, the authors did not provide sufficient information regarding the process followed in each round, including the criteria used for inclusion/exclusion and the specific method of reviewing the articles to make selection decisions. The authors should outline the steps taken in each round to allow readers to better understand the selection process and evaluate the reliability and validity of the data collection process.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development).

If the articles were restricted to a specific language, such as English, it is possible that the analysis may not represent the actual level of interest from different countries. It may underestimate the representation of countries where English is not the primary language for scholarly publications.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 12\nNA\n\n\n39\nreviewer1\nFor topic modeling, I suggest the authors provide the number of articles related to each identified topic. It can help readers gain a better understanding of the relative importance and coverage of different topics and themes in the literature.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 15\nNA\n\n\n40\nreviewer1\nFor clustering analysis, it would be helpful for the authors to include a measure of purity to assess the performance and validity of the clustering model.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 16\nNA\n\n\n41\nreviewer1\nMoreover, in addition to the previous point, the authors should provide a clear explanation of how the centrality and impact of the clusters were measured (Table 3), specifying the specific centrality metric(s) employed in their analysis, for example, is it based on degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, or eigenvector centrality?\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 17\nNA\n\n\n42\nreviewer1\nIf bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering can also identify topics and themes and even provide quantifiable measures, why topic modeling analysis is needed? Do they tell different stories or do the two analyses results converge? The authors should provide a justification for the selection of topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering. It is important to clarify whether these different analyses tell distinct stories or if their results converge.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 18,19\nNA\n\n\n43\nreviewer1\nIn Line 24-27, Page 21, it is mentioned, \"There is a growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytical approaches in the HRD scholar community.\" However, the stand-out theme related to AI was not mentioned in the findings section.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n44\nreviewer1\nIn Line 40-45, Page 21, it is mentioned that the current summary does not include any related HRD articles published in the four HRD journals sponsored by the Academy of Human Resource Development. I would like to refer you to a recently published article by Ratnam & Devi (2023) in HRDI: Ratnam, D. S., & Devi, V. R. (2023). Addressing impediments to HR analytics adoption: guide to HRD professionals. Human Resource Development International, 1-10.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n45\nreviewer1\nThe identified clusters/themes in the analysis can be mapped to portray a landscape for PA in HRD specifically, as promised in the research purpose. The authors can present a comprehensive landscape by highlighting the clusters/themes that align with HRD research and practice. This can be done by providing a summary of each relevant cluster/theme and explaining how it relates to HRD. For example, if a cluster/theme is focused on training and development practices in organizations, it can be highlighted as relevant to HRD's role in facilitating learning and skill development.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n46\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the authors can compare the findings of their study with the results of Yoon & Chae (2022) to identify any overlapping clusters/themes or areas of convergence. This can provide insights into the consistency or divergence of findings across different studies, enriching the understanding of the PA landscape in the context of HRD: Yoon, S. W., & Chae, C. (2022). Research topics and collaboration in human resource development review 2012–2021: A bibliometrics approach. Human Resource Development Review, 21(1), 24-47.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n47\nreviewer1\nThe first paragraph on Page 1 should be indented.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nApplied\nNA\n\n\n48\nreviewer1\nThe spacing between paragraphs should be double-spaced throughout the document. Don't add extra space between paragraphs or sections.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nParagraph spacing before and after has fixed\nNA\n\n\n49\nreviewer1\nWhen it comes to table titles in APA format, they should be in title case (capitalize the first letter of each significant word).\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nFixed\nNA\n\n\n50\nreviewer1\nFor Level 3 headings in APA format, they should be formatted as flush left, boldface, italicized and the first letter of the first word and the first letter of all major words in the heading are capitalized. The paragraph text should begin on the following line indented. Make sure the formatting of the Level 3 headings is consistent on pages 12 and 13.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nFixed\nNA\n\n\n51\nreviewer2\nI agree with the authors that there is potential value in such analyses as people analytics grows, and as we seek to understand linkages to HRD. However, in all candor, I am not seeing the value added of this study at this time. Some good ideas and studies are presented in pages 23-27, and yet I am not seeing how this study necessarily advances the topic of \"people analytics and HRD.\" The results in Tables 1-3 are not terribly interesting.\nOverall\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n52\nreviewer2\nI commend the authors for a strong set of references.\nOverall\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nR Core Team. 2023.

By applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we were able to exclude 14 items, which consisted of 5 book reviews, 6 editorial materials, 1 letter, 1 book review early access, and 1 editorial material early access. Consequently, we were left with 159 research articles, which accounted for approximately 79% of the total articles, 13% of the early access articles, 9% of the reviews, and 3% of the early access reviews. These articles primarily consisted of publications in the form of articles and reviews.\n\n\n9\neditor\nDetail the process of article selection, including inclusion/exclusion criteria and rounds of selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n10\neditor\nSpecify the steps taken in each round for article selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nA figure explain search term evaluation procedure added\nfigure1\n\n\n11\neditor\nYou may move the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section to the method section with a different title because it is as if you described the sample.\nAnalytics\nRevise\nMove to method section\nNA\nNA\napplied\nWhole section moved under method\n\n\n12\neditor\nIn addition, consider condensing the description in this section.

This means that our search specifically targeted literature written in the English language.\nFirst, we started a preliminary search using seed keywords related to analytics, assessments, and measurement of people in organizational contexts that written in English.\n\n\n15\neditor\nProvide the number of articles related to each topic identified\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nThe LDA/STM topic model is a useful tool for uncovering hidden topics within articles by utilizing probability calculations. It determines the likelihood of multiple dominant topics appearing in an article and calculates the probability of each identified topic occurring throughout the article. However, it is currently not feasible to accurately determine the exact number of articles related to each specific topic. In the best-case scenario, we can potentially provide suggestions regarding the top five dominant topics per article or identify the dominant topic that exceeds a certain occurrence probability threshold. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the distribution of probabilities for some topics may be heavily skewed. Furthermore, there is no widely agreed-upon consensus or established method for determining the appropriate threshold level to apply in these suggestions.\nNA\n\n\n16\neditor\nInclude a measure of purity for the clustering model\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nPurity measures, which are commonly used in supervised machine learning approaches with benchmark datasets, typically rely on mutual information. These measures are particularly employed in tree regression and clustering methods. However, when it comes to hierarchical clustering, which is a distance-based clustering approach, purity measures are not commonly utilized. Instead, other evaluation measures such as the elbow method, average silhouette method, and gap statistic method are considered more suitable for assessing hierarchical clustering. Additionally, no bibliometrics study to date has reported on the usage of these evaluation measures. Therefore, in addition to considering the characteristics of the special issue and journal, there arises a question as to whether we should include information about these evaluation methods and their corresponding processes in our report.\nNA\n\n\n17\neditor\nExplain how centrality and impact of clusters were measured and specify the centrality metrics used\nAnalytics\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd explanation in note for the figure\nThe x-axis represents the cluster centrality, which is measured using Callon's Centrality index. On the other hand, the y-axis represents the cluster impact, which is measured using the Mean Normalized Local Citation Score (MNLCS). The Normalized Local Citation Score (NLCS) of a document is determined by dividing the actual count of citations from local sources by the expected citation rate for documents published in the same year. This calculation allows for a fair comparison of citation impact across different documents, accounting for the varying expected citation rates based on the publication year.\nNA\n\n\n18\neditor\nClarify the reasons for selecting topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd contents about why we applied three method\nWhen conducting a scoping review, topic modeling, bibliocoupling, and hierarchical clustering are essential techniques, each providing a unique lens to comprehend and organize a large body of literature. Topic modeling, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is a statistical model that identifies the \"topics\" of a collection of documents. In the context of a scoping review, it is crucial to distinguish the predominant themes across the selected literature. Typically, a scoping review aims to assess the scope and depth of the existing literature on a specific topic. Utilizing topic modeling, researchers can efficiently highlight key themes and trends. Bibliocoupling, which assesses the relatedness between articles based on their shared references, complements topic modeling. This technique enables researchers to identify clusters of closely related articles, which they can then analyze to determine the subtopics or themes they represent. By identifying segments of literature that share references during a scoping review, researchers can infer that these groups may be addressing similar research questions or topics, thereby establishing a deeper level of comprehension. Hierarchical clustering offers a way to organize the identified themes or topics visually. As a type of cluster analysis, it seeks to construct a hierarchy of clusters by providing a visual representation, such as a dendrogram, of the relationships between various research themes. By employing this methodology, researchers can comprehend the intricate relationships between various fields of study and identify overarching themes or trends. Consequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature. With topic modeling illuminating key themes, bibliocoupling demonstrating the relationship between various articles, and hierarchical clustering visually representing the relationship between themes, researchers can gain an in-depth comprehension of the current state of research in a particular field. Combining these techniques provides an integrative method for comprehending the nuances and particulars of a particular field of study.\nNA\n\n\n19\neditor\nExplain whether these analyses are complementary or convergent\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nexplained in issue ID 18\nConsequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature.

In addition, italicize the journal titles.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n31\neditor\nClearly articulate the significance of your work and how it advances the field of HRD (see Reviewer 2’s comments and item #1 above.)\nETC\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n32\nreviewer1\nI believe that there is a need for this research topic to explore the boundaries and scope of PA research in HRD. However, the introduction section fails to effectively narrow down the research focus and establish a compelling problem statement for conducting this research in the field of HRD. ~~ However, the third paragraph (from Line 51-55 on Page 1 to Line 3-27 on Page 2) introduces diverse while disconnected points. It starts by removing the context and addressing concerns mainly about PA, then introduces different terms related to PA and argues for the need to clarify the definition of PA. This need, though, is not directly tied to the research question but is later addressed in the discussion section. The third paragraph concludes by mentioning increasing emphasis of PA in “HRM.” The context switch is indeed abrupt and disrupts the logical flow of the text. I suggest that the author reorganize these points to develop a coherent logical flow and frame a compelling problem statement specifically situated in the field of HRD.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n33\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the fourth paragraph (Line 29-50, Page 2) in the introduction section repeats the concerns and challenges of PA, circling back to the initial point in the third paragraph.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n34\nreviewer1\nFurthermore, on Page 2, Lines 3-6, it is stated, \"Despite these concerns, the PA scholar community has established some consensus about terms and methods.\" However, the statement is followed by a list of different PA-related terms while did not exemplify any PA methods. I recommend that the authors cite Yoon (2018, 2021) as mentioned in the second paragraph to provide examples of common PA methods to provide supporting information to the statement.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n35\nreviewer1\nIn the last paragraph of the introduction section, there is a limited discussion of the methods employed. I recommend that the authors develop a standalone method section to provide more detailed explanations of the methods used in the study. This will enable readers to understand how the measures were computed, interpret the reported matrices, and comprehend how the study arrived at its findings.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n36\nreviewer1\nIn Line 34-35, Page 5, it is stated, \"After the third round, a total of 173 articles were retrieved.\" However, the authors did not provide sufficient information regarding the process followed in each round, including the criteria used for inclusion/exclusion and the specific method of reviewing the articles to make selection decisions. The authors should outline the steps taken in each round to allow readers to better understand the selection process and evaluate the reliability and validity of the data collection process.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n37\nreviewer1\nIn the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section, starting from Page 6, Line 45, the authors provide a descriptive analysis of the data related to authors, journals, and geographical origin of the selected articles. To enhance the organization and clarity of presentation, I recommend that the authors create subheadings for each of these aspects.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 11,12,13\nNA\n\n\n38\nreviewer1\nRegarding the analysis of geographical distribution, it is important to clarify the language criteria used for selecting the articles. If the articles were restricted to a specific language, such as English, it is possible that the analysis may not represent the actual level of interest from different countries. It may underestimate the representation of countries where English is not the primary language for scholarly publications.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 12\nNA\n\n\n39\nreviewer1\nFor topic modeling, I suggest the authors provide the number of articles related to each identified topic. It can help readers gain a better understanding of the relative importance and coverage of different topics and themes in the literature.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 15\nNA\n\n\n40\nreviewer1\nFor clustering analysis, it would be helpful for the authors to include a measure of purity to assess the performance and validity of the clustering model.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 16\nNA\n\n\n41\nreviewer1\nMoreover, in addition to the previous point, the authors should provide a clear explanation of how the centrality and impact of the clusters were measured (Table 3), specifying the specific centrality metric(s) employed in their analysis, for example, is it based on degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, or eigenvector centrality?\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 17\nNA\n\n\n42\nreviewer1\nIf bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering can also identify topics and themes and even provide quantifiable measures, why topic modeling analysis is needed? Do they tell different stories or do the two analyses results converge? The authors should provide a justification for the selection of topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering. It is important to clarify whether these different analyses tell distinct stories or if their results converge.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 18,19\nNA\n\n\n43\nreviewer1\nIn Line 24-27, Page 21, it is mentioned, \"There is a growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytical approaches in the HRD scholar community.\" However, the stand-out theme related to AI was not mentioned in the findings section.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n44\nreviewer1\nIn Line 40-45, Page 21, it is mentioned that the current summary does not include any related HRD articles published in the four HRD journals sponsored by the Academy of Human Resource Development. I would like to refer you to a recently published article by Ratnam & Devi (2023) in HRDI: Ratnam, D. S., & Devi, V. R. (2023). Addressing impediments to HR analytics adoption: guide to HRD professionals. Human Resource Development International, 1-10.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n45\nreviewer1\nThe identified clusters/themes in the analysis can be mapped to portray a landscape for PA in HRD specifically, as promised in the research purpose. The authors can present a comprehensive landscape by highlighting the clusters/themes that align with HRD research and practice. This can be done by providing a summary of each relevant cluster/theme and explaining how it relates to HRD. For example, if a cluster/theme is focused on training and development practices in organizations, it can be highlighted as relevant to HRD's role in facilitating learning and skill development.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n46\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the authors can compare the findings of their study with the results of Yoon & Chae (2022) to identify any overlapping clusters/themes or areas of convergence. This can provide insights into the consistency or divergence of findings across different studies, enriching the understanding of the PA landscape in the context of HRD: Yoon, S. W., & Chae, C. (2022). Research topics and collaboration in human resource development review 2012–2021: A bibliometrics approach. Human Resource Development Review, 21(1), 24-47.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n47\nreviewer1\nThe first paragraph on Page 1 should be indented.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nApplied\nNA\n\n\n48\nreviewer1\nThe spacing between paragraphs should be double-spaced throughout the document.

Make sure the formatting of the Level 3 headings is consistent on pages 12 and 13.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nFixed\nNA\n\n\n51\nreviewer2\nI agree with the authors that there is potential value in such analyses as people analytics grows, and as we seek to understand linkages to HRD. However, in all candor, I am not seeing the value added of this study at this time. Some good ideas and studies are presented in pages 23-27, and yet I am not seeing how this study necessarily advances the topic of \"people analytics and HRD.\" The results in Tables 1-3 are not terribly interesting.\nOverall\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n52\nreviewer2\nI commend the authors for a strong set of references.\nOverall\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nR Core Team. 2023.

By applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we were able to exclude 14 items, which consisted of 5 book reviews, 6 editorial materials, 1 letter, 1 book review early access, and 1 editorial material early access. Consequently, we were left with 159 research articles, which accounted for approximately 79% of the total articles, 13% of the early access articles, 9% of the reviews, and 3% of the early access reviews. These articles primarily consisted of publications in the form of articles and reviews.\n\n\n9\neditor\nDetail the process of article selection, including inclusion/exclusion criteria and rounds of selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n10\neditor\nSpecify the steps taken in each round for article selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nA figure explain search term evaluation procedure added\nfigure1\n\n\n11\neditor\nYou may move the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section to the method section with a different title because it is as if you described the sample.\nAnalytics\nRevise\nMove to method section\nNA\nNA\napplied\nWhole section moved under method\n\n\n12\neditor\nIn addition, consider condensing the description in this section.

This means that our search specifically targeted literature written in the English language.\nFirst, we started a preliminary search using seed keywords related to analytics, assessments, and measurement of people in organizational contexts that written in English.\n\n\n15\neditor\nProvide the number of articles related to each topic identified\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nThe LDA/STM topic model is a useful tool for uncovering hidden topics within articles by utilizing probability calculations. It determines the likelihood of multiple dominant topics appearing in an article and calculates the probability of each identified topic occurring throughout the article. However, it is currently not feasible to accurately determine the exact number of articles related to each specific topic. In the best-case scenario, we can potentially provide suggestions regarding the top five dominant topics per article or identify the dominant topic that exceeds a certain occurrence probability threshold. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the distribution of probabilities for some topics may be heavily skewed. Furthermore, there is no widely agreed-upon consensus or established method for determining the appropriate threshold level to apply in these suggestions.\nNA\n\n\n16\neditor\nInclude a measure of purity for the clustering model\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nPurity measures, which are commonly used in supervised machine learning approaches with benchmark datasets, typically rely on mutual information. These measures are particularly employed in tree regression and clustering methods. However, when it comes to hierarchical clustering, which is a distance-based clustering approach, purity measures are not commonly utilized. Instead, other evaluation measures such as the elbow method, average silhouette method, and gap statistic method are considered more suitable for assessing hierarchical clustering. Additionally, no bibliometrics study to date has reported on the usage of these evaluation measures. Therefore, in addition to considering the characteristics of the special issue and journal, there arises a question as to whether we should include information about these evaluation methods and their corresponding processes in our report.\nNA\n\n\n17\neditor\nExplain how centrality and impact of clusters were measured and specify the centrality metrics used\nAnalytics\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd explanation in note for the figure\nThe x-axis represents the cluster centrality, which is measured using Callon's Centrality index. On the other hand, the y-axis represents the cluster impact, which is measured using the Mean Normalized Local Citation Score (MNLCS). The Normalized Local Citation Score (NLCS) of a document is determined by dividing the actual count of citations from local sources by the expected citation rate for documents published in the same year. This calculation allows for a fair comparison of citation impact across different documents, accounting for the varying expected citation rates based on the publication year.\nNA\n\n\n18\neditor\nClarify the reasons for selecting topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd contents about why we applied three method\nWhen conducting a scoping review, topic modeling, bibliocoupling, and hierarchical clustering are essential techniques, each providing a unique lens to comprehend and organize a large body of literature. Topic modeling, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is a statistical model that identifies the \"topics\" of a collection of documents. In the context of a scoping review, it is crucial to distinguish the predominant themes across the selected literature. Typically, a scoping review aims to assess the scope and depth of the existing literature on a specific topic. Utilizing topic modeling, researchers can efficiently highlight key themes and trends. Bibliocoupling, which assesses the relatedness between articles based on their shared references, complements topic modeling. This technique enables researchers to identify clusters of closely related articles, which they can then analyze to determine the subtopics or themes they represent. By identifying segments of literature that share references during a scoping review, researchers can infer that these groups may be addressing similar research questions or topics, thereby establishing a deeper level of comprehension. Hierarchical clustering offers a way to organize the identified themes or topics visually. As a type of cluster analysis, it seeks to construct a hierarchy of clusters by providing a visual representation, such as a dendrogram, of the relationships between various research themes. By employing this methodology, researchers can comprehend the intricate relationships between various fields of study and identify overarching themes or trends. Consequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature. With topic modeling illuminating key themes, bibliocoupling demonstrating the relationship between various articles, and hierarchical clustering visually representing the relationship between themes, researchers can gain an in-depth comprehension of the current state of research in a particular field. Combining these techniques provides an integrative method for comprehending the nuances and particulars of a particular field of study.\nNA\n\n\n19\neditor\nExplain whether these analyses are complementary or convergent\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nexplained in issue ID 18\nConsequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature.

However, the introduction section fails to effectively narrow down the research focus and establish a compelling problem statement for conducting this research in the field of HRD. ~~ However, the third paragraph (from Line 51-55 on Page 1 to Line 3-27 on Page 2) introduces diverse while disconnected points. It starts by removing the context and addressing concerns mainly about PA, then introduces different terms related to PA and argues for the need to clarify the definition of PA. This need, though, is not directly tied to the research question but is later addressed in the discussion section. The third paragraph concludes by mentioning increasing emphasis of PA in “HRM.” The context switch is indeed abrupt and disrupts the logical flow of the text. I suggest that the author reorganize these points to develop a coherent logical flow and frame a compelling problem statement specifically situated in the field of HRD.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n33\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the fourth paragraph (Line 29-50, Page 2) in the introduction section repeats the concerns and challenges of PA, circling back to the initial point in the third paragraph.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n34\nreviewer1\nFurthermore, on Page 2, Lines 3-6, it is stated, \"Despite these concerns, the PA scholar community has established some consensus about terms and methods.\" However, the statement is followed by a list of different PA-related terms while did not exemplify any PA methods. I recommend that the authors cite Yoon (2018, 2021) as mentioned in the second paragraph to provide examples of common PA methods to provide supporting information to the statement.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n35\nreviewer1\nIn the last paragraph of the introduction section, there is a limited discussion of the methods employed. I recommend that the authors develop a standalone method section to provide more detailed explanations of the methods used in the study. This will enable readers to understand how the measures were computed, interpret the reported matrices, and comprehend how the study arrived at its findings.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n36\nreviewer1\nIn Line 34-35, Page 5, it is stated, \"After the third round, a total of 173 articles were retrieved.\" However, the authors did not provide sufficient information regarding the process followed in each round, including the criteria used for inclusion/exclusion and the specific method of reviewing the articles to make selection decisions. The authors should outline the steps taken in each round to allow readers to better understand the selection process and evaluate the reliability and validity of the data collection process.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n37\nreviewer1\nIn the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section, starting from Page 6, Line 45, the authors provide a descriptive analysis of the data related to authors, journals, and geographical origin of the selected articles. To enhance the organization and clarity of presentation, I recommend that the authors create subheadings for each of these aspects.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 11,12,13\nNA\n\n\n38\nreviewer1\nRegarding the analysis of geographical distribution, it is important to clarify the language criteria used for selecting the articles. If the articles were restricted to a specific language, such as English, it is possible that the analysis may not represent the actual level of interest from different countries. It may underestimate the representation of countries where English is not the primary language for scholarly publications.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 12\nNA\n\n\n39\nreviewer1\nFor topic modeling, I suggest the authors provide the number of articles related to each identified topic.

Do they tell different stories or do the two analyses results converge? The authors should provide a justification for the selection of topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering. It is important to clarify whether these different analyses tell distinct stories or if their results converge.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 18,19\nNA\n\n\n43\nreviewer1\nIn Line 24-27, Page 21, it is mentioned, \"There is a growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytical approaches in the HRD scholar community.\" However, the stand-out theme related to AI was not mentioned in the findings section.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n44\nreviewer1\nIn Line 40-45, Page 21, it is mentioned that the current summary does not include any related HRD articles published in the four HRD journals sponsored by the Academy of Human Resource Development.

The authors can present a comprehensive landscape by highlighting the clusters/themes that align with HRD research and practice. This can be done by providing a summary of each relevant cluster/theme and explaining how it relates to HRD.

By applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we were able to exclude 14 items, which consisted of 5 book reviews, 6 editorial materials, 1 letter, 1 book review early access, and 1 editorial material early access. Consequently, we were left with 159 research articles, which accounted for approximately 79% of the total articles, 13% of the early access articles, 9% of the reviews, and 3% of the early access reviews. These articles primarily consisted of publications in the form of articles and reviews.\n\n\n9\neditor\nDetail the process of article selection, including inclusion/exclusion criteria and rounds of selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n10\neditor\nSpecify the steps taken in each round for article selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nA figure explain search term evaluation procedure added\nfigure1\n\n\n11\neditor\nYou may move the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section to the method section with a different title because it is as if you described the sample.\nAnalytics\nRevise\nMove to method section\nNA\nNA\napplied\nWhole section moved under method\n\n\n12\neditor\nIn addition, consider condensing the description in this section.

This means that our search specifically targeted literature written in the English language.\nFirst, we started a preliminary search using seed keywords related to analytics, assessments, and measurement of people in organizational contexts that written in English.\n\n\n15\neditor\nProvide the number of articles related to each topic identified\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nThe LDA/STM topic model is a useful tool for uncovering hidden topics within articles by utilizing probability calculations. It determines the likelihood of multiple dominant topics appearing in an article and calculates the probability of each identified topic occurring throughout the article. However, it is currently not feasible to accurately determine the exact number of articles related to each specific topic. In the best-case scenario, we can potentially provide suggestions regarding the top five dominant topics per article or identify the dominant topic that exceeds a certain occurrence probability threshold. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the distribution of probabilities for some topics may be heavily skewed. Furthermore, there is no widely agreed-upon consensus or established method for determining the appropriate threshold level to apply in these suggestions.\nNA\n\n\n16\neditor\nInclude a measure of purity for the clustering model\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nPurity measures, which are commonly used in supervised machine learning approaches with benchmark datasets, typically rely on mutual information. These measures are particularly employed in tree regression and clustering methods. However, when it comes to hierarchical clustering, which is a distance-based clustering approach, purity measures are not commonly utilized. Instead, other evaluation measures such as the elbow method, average silhouette method, and gap statistic method are considered more suitable for assessing hierarchical clustering. Additionally, no bibliometrics study to date has reported on the usage of these evaluation measures. Therefore, in addition to considering the characteristics of the special issue and journal, there arises a question as to whether we should include information about these evaluation methods and their corresponding processes in our report.\nNA\n\n\n17\neditor\nExplain how centrality and impact of clusters were measured and specify the centrality metrics used\nAnalytics\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd explanation in note for the figure\nThe x-axis represents the cluster centrality, which is measured using Callon's Centrality index. On the other hand, the y-axis represents the cluster impact, which is measured using the Mean Normalized Local Citation Score (MNLCS). The Normalized Local Citation Score (NLCS) of a document is determined by dividing the actual count of citations from local sources by the expected citation rate for documents published in the same year. This calculation allows for a fair comparison of citation impact across different documents, accounting for the varying expected citation rates based on the publication year.\nNA\n\n\n18\neditor\nClarify the reasons for selecting topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd contents about why we applied three method\nWhen conducting a scoping review, topic modeling, bibliocoupling, and hierarchical clustering are essential techniques, each providing a unique lens to comprehend and organize a large body of literature. Topic modeling, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is a statistical model that identifies the \"topics\" of a collection of documents. In the context of a scoping review, it is crucial to distinguish the predominant themes across the selected literature. Typically, a scoping review aims to assess the scope and depth of the existing literature on a specific topic. Utilizing topic modeling, researchers can efficiently highlight key themes and trends. Bibliocoupling, which assesses the relatedness between articles based on their shared references, complements topic modeling. This technique enables researchers to identify clusters of closely related articles, which they can then analyze to determine the subtopics or themes they represent. By identifying segments of literature that share references during a scoping review, researchers can infer that these groups may be addressing similar research questions or topics, thereby establishing a deeper level of comprehension. Hierarchical clustering offers a way to organize the identified themes or topics visually. As a type of cluster analysis, it seeks to construct a hierarchy of clusters by providing a visual representation, such as a dendrogram, of the relationships between various research themes. By employing this methodology, researchers can comprehend the intricate relationships between various fields of study and identify overarching themes or trends. Consequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature. With topic modeling illuminating key themes, bibliocoupling demonstrating the relationship between various articles, and hierarchical clustering visually representing the relationship between themes, researchers can gain an in-depth comprehension of the current state of research in a particular field. Combining these techniques provides an integrative method for comprehending the nuances and particulars of a particular field of study.\nNA\n\n\n19\neditor\nExplain whether these analyses are complementary or convergent\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nexplained in issue ID 18\nConsequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature.

However, the introduction section fails to effectively narrow down the research focus and establish a compelling problem statement for conducting this research in the field of HRD. ~~ However, the third paragraph (from Line 51-55 on Page 1 to Line 3-27 on Page 2) introduces diverse while disconnected points. It starts by removing the context and addressing concerns mainly about PA, then introduces different terms related to PA and argues for the need to clarify the definition of PA. This need, though, is not directly tied to the research question but is later addressed in the discussion section. The third paragraph concludes by mentioning increasing emphasis of PA in “HRM.” The context switch is indeed abrupt and disrupts the logical flow of the text. I suggest that the author reorganize these points to develop a coherent logical flow and frame a compelling problem statement specifically situated in the field of HRD.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n33\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the fourth paragraph (Line 29-50, Page 2) in the introduction section repeats the concerns and challenges of PA, circling back to the initial point in the third paragraph.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n34\nreviewer1\nFurthermore, on Page 2, Lines 3-6, it is stated, \"Despite these concerns, the PA scholar community has established some consensus about terms and methods.\" However, the statement is followed by a list of different PA-related terms while did not exemplify any PA methods. I recommend that the authors cite Yoon (2018, 2021) as mentioned in the second paragraph to provide examples of common PA methods to provide supporting information to the statement.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n35\nreviewer1\nIn the last paragraph of the introduction section, there is a limited discussion of the methods employed. I recommend that the authors develop a standalone method section to provide more detailed explanations of the methods used in the study. This will enable readers to understand how the measures were computed, interpret the reported matrices, and comprehend how the study arrived at its findings.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n36\nreviewer1\nIn Line 34-35, Page 5, it is stated, \"After the third round, a total of 173 articles were retrieved.\" However, the authors did not provide sufficient information regarding the process followed in each round, including the criteria used for inclusion/exclusion and the specific method of reviewing the articles to make selection decisions. The authors should outline the steps taken in each round to allow readers to better understand the selection process and evaluate the reliability and validity of the data collection process.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development).

To enhance the organization and clarity of presentation, I recommend that the authors create subheadings for each of these aspects.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 11,12,13\nNA\n\n\n38\nreviewer1\nRegarding the analysis of geographical distribution, it is important to clarify the language criteria used for selecting the articles. If the articles were restricted to a specific language, such as English, it is possible that the analysis may not represent the actual level of interest from different countries. It may underestimate the representation of countries where English is not the primary language for scholarly publications.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 12\nNA\n\n\n39\nreviewer1\nFor topic modeling, I suggest the authors provide the number of articles related to each identified topic.

Do they tell different stories or do the two analyses results converge? The authors should provide a justification for the selection of topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering.

The authors can present a comprehensive landscape by highlighting the clusters/themes that align with HRD research and practice. This can be done by providing a summary of each relevant cluster/theme and explaining how it relates to HRD.

By applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we were able to exclude 14 items, which consisted of 5 book reviews, 6 editorial materials, 1 letter, 1 book review early access, and 1 editorial material early access. Consequently, we were left with 159 research articles, which accounted for approximately 79% of the total articles, 13% of the early access articles, 9% of the reviews, and 3% of the early access reviews. These articles primarily consisted of publications in the form of articles and reviews.\n\n\n9\neditor\nDetail the process of article selection, including inclusion/exclusion criteria and rounds of selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n10\neditor\nSpecify the steps taken in each round for article selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nA figure explain search term evaluation procedure added\nfigure1\n\n\n11\neditor\nYou may move the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section to the method section with a different title because it is as if you described the sample.\nAnalytics\nRevise\nMove to method section\nNA\nNA\napplied\nWhole section moved under method\n\n\n12\neditor\nIn addition, consider condensing the description in this section.

This means that our search specifically targeted literature written in the English language.\nFirst, we started a preliminary search using seed keywords related to analytics, assessments, and measurement of people in organizational contexts that written in English.\n\n\n15\neditor\nProvide the number of articles related to each topic identified\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nThe LDA/STM topic model is a useful tool for uncovering hidden topics within articles by utilizing probability calculations. It determines the likelihood of multiple dominant topics appearing in an article and calculates the probability of each identified topic occurring throughout the article. However, it is currently not feasible to accurately determine the exact number of articles related to each specific topic. In the best-case scenario, we can potentially provide suggestions regarding the top five dominant topics per article or identify the dominant topic that exceeds a certain occurrence probability threshold. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the distribution of probabilities for some topics may be heavily skewed. Furthermore, there is no widely agreed-upon consensus or established method for determining the appropriate threshold level to apply in these suggestions.\nNA\n\n\n16\neditor\nInclude a measure of purity for the clustering model\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nPurity measures, which are commonly used in supervised machine learning approaches with benchmark datasets, typically rely on mutual information. These measures are particularly employed in tree regression and clustering methods. However, when it comes to hierarchical clustering, which is a distance-based clustering approach, purity measures are not commonly utilized. Instead, other evaluation measures such as the elbow method, average silhouette method, and gap statistic method are considered more suitable for assessing hierarchical clustering. Additionally, no bibliometrics study to date has reported on the usage of these evaluation measures. Therefore, in addition to considering the characteristics of the special issue and journal, there arises a question as to whether we should include information about these evaluation methods and their corresponding processes in our report.\nNA\n\n\n17\neditor\nExplain how centrality and impact of clusters were measured and specify the centrality metrics used\nAnalytics\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd explanation in note for the figure\nThe x-axis represents the cluster centrality, which is measured using Callon's Centrality index. On the other hand, the y-axis represents the cluster impact, which is measured using the Mean Normalized Local Citation Score (MNLCS). The Normalized Local Citation Score (NLCS) of a document is determined by dividing the actual count of citations from local sources by the expected citation rate for documents published in the same year. This calculation allows for a fair comparison of citation impact across different documents, accounting for the varying expected citation rates based on the publication year.\nNA\n\n\n18\neditor\nClarify the reasons for selecting topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd contents about why we applied three method\nWhen conducting a scoping review, topic modeling, bibliocoupling, and hierarchical clustering are essential techniques, each providing a unique lens to comprehend and organize a large body of literature. Topic modeling, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is a statistical model that identifies the \"topics\" of a collection of documents. In the context of a scoping review, it is crucial to distinguish the predominant themes across the selected literature. Typically, a scoping review aims to assess the scope and depth of the existing literature on a specific topic. Utilizing topic modeling, researchers can efficiently highlight key themes and trends. Bibliocoupling, which assesses the relatedness between articles based on their shared references, complements topic modeling. This technique enables researchers to identify clusters of closely related articles, which they can then analyze to determine the subtopics or themes they represent. By identifying segments of literature that share references during a scoping review, researchers can infer that these groups may be addressing similar research questions or topics, thereby establishing a deeper level of comprehension. Hierarchical clustering offers a way to organize the identified themes or topics visually. As a type of cluster analysis, it seeks to construct a hierarchy of clusters by providing a visual representation, such as a dendrogram, of the relationships between various research themes. By employing this methodology, researchers can comprehend the intricate relationships between various fields of study and identify overarching themes or trends. Consequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature. With topic modeling illuminating key themes, bibliocoupling demonstrating the relationship between various articles, and hierarchical clustering visually representing the relationship between themes, researchers can gain an in-depth comprehension of the current state of research in a particular field. Combining these techniques provides an integrative method for comprehending the nuances and particulars of a particular field of study.\nNA\n\n\n19\neditor\nExplain whether these analyses are complementary or convergent\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nexplained in issue ID 18\nConsequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature.

You have 20 topics that are grouped into four themes as well as 7 clusters. What do they do for HRD practice and research? There seems to be a lack of justification for having both.

However, it is difficult to envision how the findings can be useful for HRD practice. Although you discussed some implications for HRD practice, the core content is not based on the main findings. This is a critical challenge.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n26\neditor\nCreate the limitations section and address limitations along with its delimitation and methodological limitations\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n27\neditor\nSplit the “Implications for Future Research and Practice” section into “Implications for HRD Research,” “Implications for HRD Practice,” “Study Limitations,” and “Recommendations for Future Research.”\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n28\neditor\nYou proposed what PA should focus on. Please make it clear that your proposal is based on the findings and sufficiently covers the scope of HRD. Organizational effectiveness or organization development-related domains seem to be missing. This leads us to believe that perhaps leaving out the definitions of PA might be necessary.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n29\neditor\nWhy do you need the definitions along with the new one to achieve the purpose of this study? How is it relevant to the research purpose or the RQs? You might need to introduce some of them in the introduction section in a concise manner.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n30\neditor\nAddress APA format issues as Reviewer 1 raised.

However, the introduction section fails to effectively narrow down the research focus and establish a compelling problem statement for conducting this research in the field of HRD. ~~ However, the third paragraph (from Line 51-55 on Page 1 to Line 3-27 on Page 2) introduces diverse while disconnected points. It starts by removing the context and addressing concerns mainly about PA, then introduces different terms related to PA and argues for the need to clarify the definition of PA. This need, though, is not directly tied to the research question but is later addressed in the discussion section. The third paragraph concludes by mentioning increasing emphasis of PA in “HRM.” The context switch is indeed abrupt and disrupts the logical flow of the text. I suggest that the author reorganize these points to develop a coherent logical flow and frame a compelling problem statement specifically situated in the field of HRD.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n33\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the fourth paragraph (Line 29-50, Page 2) in the introduction section repeats the concerns and challenges of PA, circling back to the initial point in the third paragraph.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n34\nreviewer1\nFurthermore, on Page 2, Lines 3-6, it is stated, \"Despite these concerns, the PA scholar community has established some consensus about terms and methods.\" However, the statement is followed by a list of different PA-related terms while did not exemplify any PA methods. I recommend that the authors cite Yoon (2018, 2021) as mentioned in the second paragraph to provide examples of common PA methods to provide supporting information to the statement.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n35\nreviewer1\nIn the last paragraph of the introduction section, there is a limited discussion of the methods employed. I recommend that the authors develop a standalone method section to provide more detailed explanations of the methods used in the study. This will enable readers to understand how the measures were computed, interpret the reported matrices, and comprehend how the study arrived at its findings.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n36\nreviewer1\nIn Line 34-35, Page 5, it is stated, \"After the third round, a total of 173 articles were retrieved.\" However, the authors did not provide sufficient information regarding the process followed in each round, including the criteria used for inclusion/exclusion and the specific method of reviewing the articles to make selection decisions. The authors should outline the steps taken in each round to allow readers to better understand the selection process and evaluate the reliability and validity of the data collection process.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n37\nreviewer1\nIn the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section, starting from Page 6, Line 45, the authors provide a descriptive analysis of the data related to authors, journals, and geographical origin of the selected articles. To enhance the organization and clarity of presentation, I recommend that the authors create subheadings for each of these aspects.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 11,12,13\nNA\n\n\n38\nreviewer1\nRegarding the analysis of geographical distribution, it is important to clarify the language criteria used for selecting the articles. If the articles were restricted to a specific language, such as English, it is possible that the analysis may not represent the actual level of interest from different countries. It may underestimate the representation of countries where English is not the primary language for scholarly publications.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 12\nNA\n\n\n39\nreviewer1\nFor topic modeling, I suggest the authors provide the number of articles related to each identified topic. It can help readers gain a better understanding of the relative importance and coverage of different topics and themes in the literature.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 15\nNA\n\n\n40\nreviewer1\nFor clustering analysis, it would be helpful for the authors to include a measure of purity to assess the performance and validity of the clustering model.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 16\nNA\n\n\n41\nreviewer1\nMoreover, in addition to the previous point, the authors should provide a clear explanation of how the centrality and impact of the clusters were measured (Table 3), specifying the specific centrality metric(s) employed in their analysis, for example, is it based on degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, or eigenvector centrality?\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 17\nNA\n\n\n42\nreviewer1\nIf bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering can also identify topics and themes and even provide quantifiable measures, why topic modeling analysis is needed? Do they tell different stories or do the two analyses results converge? The authors should provide a justification for the selection of topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering. It is important to clarify whether these different analyses tell distinct stories or if their results converge.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 18,19\nNA\n\n\n43\nreviewer1\nIn Line 24-27, Page 21, it is mentioned, \"There is a growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytical approaches in the HRD scholar community.\" However, the stand-out theme related to AI was not mentioned in the findings section.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n44\nreviewer1\nIn Line 40-45, Page 21, it is mentioned that the current summary does not include any related HRD articles published in the four HRD journals sponsored by the Academy of Human Resource Development. I would like to refer you to a recently published article by Ratnam & Devi (2023) in HRDI: Ratnam, D. S., & Devi, V. R. (2023). Addressing impediments to HR analytics adoption: guide to HRD professionals. Human Resource Development International, 1-10.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n45\nreviewer1\nThe identified clusters/themes in the analysis can be mapped to portray a landscape for PA in HRD specifically, as promised in the research purpose. The authors can present a comprehensive landscape by highlighting the clusters/themes that align with HRD research and practice. This can be done by providing a summary of each relevant cluster/theme and explaining how it relates to HRD. For example, if a cluster/theme is focused on training and development practices in organizations, it can be highlighted as relevant to HRD's role in facilitating learning and skill development.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n46\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the authors can compare the findings of their study with the results of Yoon & Chae (2022) to identify any overlapping clusters/themes or areas of convergence. This can provide insights into the consistency or divergence of findings across different studies, enriching the understanding of the PA landscape in the context of HRD: Yoon, S. W., & Chae, C. (2022). Research topics and collaboration in human resource development review 2012–2021: A bibliometrics approach. Human Resource Development Review, 21(1), 24-47.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n47\nreviewer1\nThe first paragraph on Page 1 should be indented.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nApplied\nNA\n\n\n48\nreviewer1\nThe spacing between paragraphs should be double-spaced throughout the document. Don't add extra space between paragraphs or sections.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nParagraph spacing before and after has fixed\nNA\n\n\n49\nreviewer1\nWhen it comes to table titles in APA format, they should be in title case (capitalize the first letter of each significant word).\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nFixed\nNA\n\n\n50\nreviewer1\nFor Level 3 headings in APA format, they should be formatted as flush left, boldface, italicized and the first letter of the first word and the first letter of all major words in the heading are capitalized. The paragraph text should begin on the following line indented. Make sure the formatting of the Level 3 headings is consistent on pages 12 and 13.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nFixed\nNA\n\n\n51\nreviewer2\nI agree with the authors that there is potential value in such analyses as people analytics grows, and as we seek to understand linkages to HRD. However, in all candor, I am not seeing the value added of this study at this time. Some good ideas and studies are presented in pages 23-27, and yet I am not seeing how this study necessarily advances the topic of \"people analytics and HRD.\" The results in Tables 1-3 are not terribly interesting.\nOverall\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n52\nreviewer2\nI commend the authors for a strong set of references.\nOverall\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nR Core Team. 2023.

By applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we were able to exclude 14 items, which consisted of 5 book reviews, 6 editorial materials, 1 letter, 1 book review early access, and 1 editorial material early access. Consequently, we were left with 159 research articles, which accounted for approximately 79% of the total articles, 13% of the early access articles, 9% of the reviews, and 3% of the early access reviews. These articles primarily consisted of publications in the form of articles and reviews.\n\n\n9\neditor\nDetail the process of article selection, including inclusion/exclusion criteria and rounds of selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n10\neditor\nSpecify the steps taken in each round for article selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nA figure explain search term evaluation procedure added\nfigure1\n\n\n11\neditor\nYou may move the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section to the method section with a different title because it is as if you described the sample.\nAnalytics\nRevise\nMove to method section\nNA\nNA\napplied\nWhole section moved under method\n\n\n12\neditor\nIn addition, consider condensing the description in this section.

This means that our search specifically targeted literature written in the English language.\nFirst, we started a preliminary search using seed keywords related to analytics, assessments, and measurement of people in organizational contexts that written in English.\n\n\n15\neditor\nProvide the number of articles related to each topic identified\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nThe LDA/STM topic model is a useful tool for uncovering hidden topics within articles by utilizing probability calculations. It determines the likelihood of multiple dominant topics appearing in an article and calculates the probability of each identified topic occurring throughout the article. However, it is currently not feasible to accurately determine the exact number of articles related to each specific topic. In the best-case scenario, we can potentially provide suggestions regarding the top five dominant topics per article or identify the dominant topic that exceeds a certain occurrence probability threshold. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the distribution of probabilities for some topics may be heavily skewed. Furthermore, there is no widely agreed-upon consensus or established method for determining the appropriate threshold level to apply in these suggestions.\nNA\n\n\n16\neditor\nInclude a measure of purity for the clustering model\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nPurity measures, which are commonly used in supervised machine learning approaches with benchmark datasets, typically rely on mutual information. These measures are particularly employed in tree regression and clustering methods. However, when it comes to hierarchical clustering, which is a distance-based clustering approach, purity measures are not commonly utilized. Instead, other evaluation measures such as the elbow method, average silhouette method, and gap statistic method are considered more suitable for assessing hierarchical clustering. Additionally, no bibliometrics study to date has reported on the usage of these evaluation measures. Therefore, in addition to considering the characteristics of the special issue and journal, there arises a question as to whether we should include information about these evaluation methods and their corresponding processes in our report.\nNA\n\n\n17\neditor\nExplain how centrality and impact of clusters were measured and specify the centrality metrics used\nAnalytics\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd explanation in note for the figure\nThe x-axis represents the cluster centrality, which is measured using Callon's Centrality index. On the other hand, the y-axis represents the cluster impact, which is measured using the Mean Normalized Local Citation Score (MNLCS). The Normalized Local Citation Score (NLCS) of a document is determined by dividing the actual count of citations from local sources by the expected citation rate for documents published in the same year. This calculation allows for a fair comparison of citation impact across different documents, accounting for the varying expected citation rates based on the publication year.\nNA\n\n\n18\neditor\nClarify the reasons for selecting topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd contents about why we applied three method\nWhen conducting a scoping review, topic modeling, bibliocoupling, and hierarchical clustering are essential techniques, each providing a unique lens to comprehend and organize a large body of literature. Topic modeling, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is a statistical model that identifies the \"topics\" of a collection of documents. In the context of a scoping review, it is crucial to distinguish the predominant themes across the selected literature. Typically, a scoping review aims to assess the scope and depth of the existing literature on a specific topic. Utilizing topic modeling, researchers can efficiently highlight key themes and trends. Bibliocoupling, which assesses the relatedness between articles based on their shared references, complements topic modeling. This technique enables researchers to identify clusters of closely related articles, which they can then analyze to determine the subtopics or themes they represent. By identifying segments of literature that share references during a scoping review, researchers can infer that these groups may be addressing similar research questions or topics, thereby establishing a deeper level of comprehension. Hierarchical clustering offers a way to organize the identified themes or topics visually. As a type of cluster analysis, it seeks to construct a hierarchy of clusters by providing a visual representation, such as a dendrogram, of the relationships between various research themes. By employing this methodology, researchers can comprehend the intricate relationships between various fields of study and identify overarching themes or trends. Consequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature. With topic modeling illuminating key themes, bibliocoupling demonstrating the relationship between various articles, and hierarchical clustering visually representing the relationship between themes, researchers can gain an in-depth comprehension of the current state of research in a particular field. Combining these techniques provides an integrative method for comprehending the nuances and particulars of a particular field of study.\nNA\n\n\n19\neditor\nExplain whether these analyses are complementary or convergent\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nexplained in issue ID 18\nConsequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature.

Considering the literature that the editor suggest, I can't find any contribution or reason to add\nNA\nNA\n\n\n21\neditor\nFor readers who may not be familiar with technical terms, please kindly explain what some numbers mean (e.g., K=20 on p. 9).\nFindings\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd explanation\nWhen determining the optimal number of topics (K), ~ The data suggested that a balance between these factors is achieved at K=20 (a model with 20 topics).\nNA\n\n\n22\neditor\nMap the identified clusters/themes to portray the landscape for PA in HRD. You have 20 topics that are grouped into four themes as well as 7 clusters. What do they do for HRD practice and research? There seems to be a lack of justification for having both.

However, it is difficult to envision how the findings can be useful for HRD practice. Although you discussed some implications for HRD practice, the core content is not based on the main findings. This is a critical challenge.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n26\neditor\nCreate the limitations section and address limitations along with its delimitation and methodological limitations\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n27\neditor\nSplit the “Implications for Future Research and Practice” section into “Implications for HRD Research,” “Implications for HRD Practice,” “Study Limitations,” and “Recommendations for Future Research.”\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n28\neditor\nYou proposed what PA should focus on. Please make it clear that your proposal is based on the findings and sufficiently covers the scope of HRD. Organizational effectiveness or organization development-related domains seem to be missing. This leads us to believe that perhaps leaving out the definitions of PA might be necessary.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n29\neditor\nWhy do you need the definitions along with the new one to achieve the purpose of this study? How is it relevant to the research purpose or the RQs? You might need to introduce some of them in the introduction section in a concise manner.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n30\neditor\nAddress APA format issues as Reviewer 1 raised. In addition, italicize the journal titles.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n31\neditor\nClearly articulate the significance of your work and how it advances the field of HRD (see Reviewer 2’s comments and item #1 above.)\nETC\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n32\nreviewer1\nI believe that there is a need for this research topic to explore the boundaries and scope of PA research in HRD. However, the introduction section fails to effectively narrow down the research focus and establish a compelling problem statement for conducting this research in the field of HRD. ~~ However, the third paragraph (from Line 51-55 on Page 1 to Line 3-27 on Page 2) introduces diverse while disconnected points. It starts by removing the context and addressing concerns mainly about PA, then introduces different terms related to PA and argues for the need to clarify the definition of PA. This need, though, is not directly tied to the research question but is later addressed in the discussion section. The third paragraph concludes by mentioning increasing emphasis of PA in “HRM.” The context switch is indeed abrupt and disrupts the logical flow of the text. I suggest that the author reorganize these points to develop a coherent logical flow and frame a compelling problem statement specifically situated in the field of HRD.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n33\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the fourth paragraph (Line 29-50, Page 2) in the introduction section repeats the concerns and challenges of PA, circling back to the initial point in the third paragraph.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n34\nreviewer1\nFurthermore, on Page 2, Lines 3-6, it is stated, \"Despite these concerns, the PA scholar community has established some consensus about terms and methods.\" However, the statement is followed by a list of different PA-related terms while did not exemplify any PA methods. I recommend that the authors cite Yoon (2018, 2021) as mentioned in the second paragraph to provide examples of common PA methods to provide supporting information to the statement.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n35\nreviewer1\nIn the last paragraph of the introduction section, there is a limited discussion of the methods employed. I recommend that the authors develop a standalone method section to provide more detailed explanations of the methods used in the study. This will enable readers to understand how the measures were computed, interpret the reported matrices, and comprehend how the study arrived at its findings.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n36\nreviewer1\nIn Line 34-35, Page 5, it is stated, \"After the third round, a total of 173 articles were retrieved.\" However, the authors did not provide sufficient information regarding the process followed in each round, including the criteria used for inclusion/exclusion and the specific method of reviewing the articles to make selection decisions. The authors should outline the steps taken in each round to allow readers to better understand the selection process and evaluate the reliability and validity of the data collection process.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development).

To enhance the organization and clarity of presentation, I recommend that the authors create subheadings for each of these aspects.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 11,12,13\nNA\n\n\n38\nreviewer1\nRegarding the analysis of geographical distribution, it is important to clarify the language criteria used for selecting the articles. If the articles were restricted to a specific language, such as English, it is possible that the analysis may not represent the actual level of interest from different countries. It may underestimate the representation of countries where English is not the primary language for scholarly publications.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 12\nNA\n\n\n39\nreviewer1\nFor topic modeling, I suggest the authors provide the number of articles related to each identified topic. It can help readers gain a better understanding of the relative importance and coverage of different topics and themes in the literature.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 15\nNA\n\n\n40\nreviewer1\nFor clustering analysis, it would be helpful for the authors to include a measure of purity to assess the performance and validity of the clustering model.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 16\nNA\n\n\n41\nreviewer1\nMoreover, in addition to the previous point, the authors should provide a clear explanation of how the centrality and impact of the clusters were measured (Table 3), specifying the specific centrality metric(s) employed in their analysis, for example, is it based on degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, or eigenvector centrality?\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 17\nNA\n\n\n42\nreviewer1\nIf bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering can also identify topics and themes and even provide quantifiable measures, why topic modeling analysis is needed? Do they tell different stories or do the two analyses results converge? The authors should provide a justification for the selection of topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering. It is important to clarify whether these different analyses tell distinct stories or if their results converge.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 18,19\nNA\n\n\n43\nreviewer1\nIn Line 24-27, Page 21, it is mentioned, \"There is a growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytical approaches in the HRD scholar community.\" However, the stand-out theme related to AI was not mentioned in the findings section.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n44\nreviewer1\nIn Line 40-45, Page 21, it is mentioned that the current summary does not include any related HRD articles published in the four HRD journals sponsored by the Academy of Human Resource Development. I would like to refer you to a recently published article by Ratnam & Devi (2023) in HRDI: Ratnam, D. S., & Devi, V. R. (2023). Addressing impediments to HR analytics adoption: guide to HRD professionals. Human Resource Development International, 1-10.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n45\nreviewer1\nThe identified clusters/themes in the analysis can be mapped to portray a landscape for PA in HRD specifically, as promised in the research purpose. The authors can present a comprehensive landscape by highlighting the clusters/themes that align with HRD research and practice. This can be done by providing a summary of each relevant cluster/theme and explaining how it relates to HRD. For example, if a cluster/theme is focused on training and development practices in organizations, it can be highlighted as relevant to HRD's role in facilitating learning and skill development.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n46\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the authors can compare the findings of their study with the results of Yoon & Chae (2022) to identify any overlapping clusters/themes or areas of convergence. This can provide insights into the consistency or divergence of findings across different studies, enriching the understanding of the PA landscape in the context of HRD: Yoon, S. W., & Chae, C. (2022). Research topics and collaboration in human resource development review 2012–2021: A bibliometrics approach. Human Resource Development Review, 21(1), 24-47.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n47\nreviewer1\nThe first paragraph on Page 1 should be indented.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nApplied\nNA\n\n\n48\nreviewer1\nThe spacing between paragraphs should be double-spaced throughout the document. Don't add extra space between paragraphs or sections.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nParagraph spacing before and after has fixed\nNA\n\n\n49\nreviewer1\nWhen it comes to table titles in APA format, they should be in title case (capitalize the first letter of each significant word).\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nFixed\nNA\n\n\n50\nreviewer1\nFor Level 3 headings in APA format, they should be formatted as flush left, boldface, italicized and the first letter of the first word and the first letter of all major words in the heading are capitalized.

Make sure the formatting of the Level 3 headings is consistent on pages 12 and 13.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nFixed\nNA\n\n\n51\nreviewer2\nI agree with the authors that there is potential value in such analyses as people analytics grows, and as we seek to understand linkages to HRD. However, in all candor, I am not seeing the value added of this study at this time. Some good ideas and studies are presented in pages 23-27, and yet I am not seeing how this study necessarily advances the topic of \"people analytics and HRD.\" The results in Tables 1-3 are not terribly interesting.\nOverall\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n52\nreviewer2\nI commend the authors for a strong set of references.\nOverall\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nR Core Team. 2023.

By applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we were able to exclude 14 items, which consisted of 5 book reviews, 6 editorial materials, 1 letter, 1 book review early access, and 1 editorial material early access. Consequently, we were left with 159 research articles, which accounted for approximately 79% of the total articles, 13% of the early access articles, 9% of the reviews, and 3% of the early access reviews. These articles primarily consisted of publications in the form of articles and reviews.\n\n\n9\neditor\nDetail the process of article selection, including inclusion/exclusion criteria and rounds of selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n10\neditor\nSpecify the steps taken in each round for article selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nA figure explain search term evaluation procedure added\nfigure1\n\n\n11\neditor\nYou may move the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section to the method section with a different title because it is as if you described the sample.\nAnalytics\nRevise\nMove to method section\nNA\nNA\napplied\nWhole section moved under method\n\n\n12\neditor\nIn addition, consider condensing the description in this section.

This means that our search specifically targeted literature written in the English language.\nFirst, we started a preliminary search using seed keywords related to analytics, assessments, and measurement of people in organizational contexts that written in English.\n\n\n15\neditor\nProvide the number of articles related to each topic identified\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nThe LDA/STM topic model is a useful tool for uncovering hidden topics within articles by utilizing probability calculations. It determines the likelihood of multiple dominant topics appearing in an article and calculates the probability of each identified topic occurring throughout the article. However, it is currently not feasible to accurately determine the exact number of articles related to each specific topic. In the best-case scenario, we can potentially provide suggestions regarding the top five dominant topics per article or identify the dominant topic that exceeds a certain occurrence probability threshold. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the distribution of probabilities for some topics may be heavily skewed. Furthermore, there is no widely agreed-upon consensus or established method for determining the appropriate threshold level to apply in these suggestions.\nNA\n\n\n16\neditor\nInclude a measure of purity for the clustering model\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nPurity measures, which are commonly used in supervised machine learning approaches with benchmark datasets, typically rely on mutual information. These measures are particularly employed in tree regression and clustering methods. However, when it comes to hierarchical clustering, which is a distance-based clustering approach, purity measures are not commonly utilized. Instead, other evaluation measures such as the elbow method, average silhouette method, and gap statistic method are considered more suitable for assessing hierarchical clustering. Additionally, no bibliometrics study to date has reported on the usage of these evaluation measures. Therefore, in addition to considering the characteristics of the special issue and journal, there arises a question as to whether we should include information about these evaluation methods and their corresponding processes in our report.\nNA\n\n\n17\neditor\nExplain how centrality and impact of clusters were measured and specify the centrality metrics used\nAnalytics\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd explanation in note for the figure\nThe x-axis represents the cluster centrality, which is measured using Callon's Centrality index. On the other hand, the y-axis represents the cluster impact, which is measured using the Mean Normalized Local Citation Score (MNLCS). The Normalized Local Citation Score (NLCS) of a document is determined by dividing the actual count of citations from local sources by the expected citation rate for documents published in the same year. This calculation allows for a fair comparison of citation impact across different documents, accounting for the varying expected citation rates based on the publication year.\nNA\n\n\n18\neditor\nClarify the reasons for selecting topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd contents about why we applied three method\nWhen conducting a scoping review, topic modeling, bibliocoupling, and hierarchical clustering are essential techniques, each providing a unique lens to comprehend and organize a large body of literature. Topic modeling, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is a statistical model that identifies the \"topics\" of a collection of documents. In the context of a scoping review, it is crucial to distinguish the predominant themes across the selected literature. Typically, a scoping review aims to assess the scope and depth of the existing literature on a specific topic. Utilizing topic modeling, researchers can efficiently highlight key themes and trends. Bibliocoupling, which assesses the relatedness between articles based on their shared references, complements topic modeling. This technique enables researchers to identify clusters of closely related articles, which they can then analyze to determine the subtopics or themes they represent. By identifying segments of literature that share references during a scoping review, researchers can infer that these groups may be addressing similar research questions or topics, thereby establishing a deeper level of comprehension. Hierarchical clustering offers a way to organize the identified themes or topics visually. As a type of cluster analysis, it seeks to construct a hierarchy of clusters by providing a visual representation, such as a dendrogram, of the relationships between various research themes. By employing this methodology, researchers can comprehend the intricate relationships between various fields of study and identify overarching themes or trends. Consequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature. With topic modeling illuminating key themes, bibliocoupling demonstrating the relationship between various articles, and hierarchical clustering visually representing the relationship between themes, researchers can gain an in-depth comprehension of the current state of research in a particular field. Combining these techniques provides an integrative method for comprehending the nuances and particulars of a particular field of study.\nNA\n\n\n19\neditor\nExplain whether these analyses are complementary or convergent\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nexplained in issue ID 18\nConsequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature. With topic modeling illuminating key themes, bibliocoupling demonstrating the relationship between various articles, and hierarchical clustering visually representing the relationship between themes, researchers can gain an in-depth comprehension of the current state of research in a particular field. Combining these techniques provides an integrative method for comprehending the nuances and particulars of a particular field of study.\nNA\n\n\n20\neditor\nInclude recent articles relevant to HRD, such as Ratnam & Devi (2023)\nAnalytical Techniques\n??\nNA\nYoon\nIs it really necessary? Considering the literature that the editor suggest, I can't find any contribution or reason to add\nNA\nNA\n\n\n21\neditor\nFor readers who may not be familiar with technical terms, please kindly explain what some numbers mean (e.g., K=20 on p. 9).\nFindings\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd explanation\nWhen determining the optimal number of topics (K), ~ The data suggested that a balance between these factors is achieved at K=20 (a model with 20 topics).\nNA\n\n\n22\neditor\nMap the identified clusters/themes to portray the landscape for PA in HRD. You have 20 topics that are grouped into four themes as well as 7 clusters. What do they do for HRD practice and research? There seems to be a lack of justification for having both. If it was to triangulate the findings, there needs to be a synthesized discussion.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n23\neditor\nHighlight clusters/themes relevant to HRD research AND practice.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n24\neditor\nCompare findings with other studies (e.g., Yoon & Chae, 2022) to identify convergences or divergences.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n25\neditor\nThis study may give some guidance for HRD and PA research relevant to HRD. However, it is difficult to envision how the findings can be useful for HRD practice. Although you discussed some implications for HRD practice, the core content is not based on the main findings. This is a critical challenge.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n26\neditor\nCreate the limitations section and address limitations along with its delimitation and methodological limitations\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n27\neditor\nSplit the “Implications for Future Research and Practice” section into “Implications for HRD Research,” “Implications for HRD Practice,” “Study Limitations,” and “Recommendations for Future Research.”\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n28\neditor\nYou proposed what PA should focus on. Please make it clear that your proposal is based on the findings and sufficiently covers the scope of HRD. Organizational effectiveness or organization development-related domains seem to be missing. This leads us to believe that perhaps leaving out the definitions of PA might be necessary.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n29\neditor\nWhy do you need the definitions along with the new one to achieve the purpose of this study? How is it relevant to the research purpose or the RQs? You might need to introduce some of them in the introduction section in a concise manner.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n30\neditor\nAddress APA format issues as Reviewer 1 raised. In addition, italicize the journal titles.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n31\neditor\nClearly articulate the significance of your work and how it advances the field of HRD (see Reviewer 2’s comments and item #1 above.)\nETC\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n32\nreviewer1\nI believe that there is a need for this research topic to explore the boundaries and scope of PA research in HRD. However, the introduction section fails to effectively narrow down the research focus and establish a compelling problem statement for conducting this research in the field of HRD. ~~ However, the third paragraph (from Line 51-55 on Page 1 to Line 3-27 on Page 2) introduces diverse while disconnected points. It starts by removing the context and addressing concerns mainly about PA, then introduces different terms related to PA and argues for the need to clarify the definition of PA. This need, though, is not directly tied to the research question but is later addressed in the discussion section. The third paragraph concludes by mentioning increasing emphasis of PA in “HRM.” The context switch is indeed abrupt and disrupts the logical flow of the text. I suggest that the author reorganize these points to develop a coherent logical flow and frame a compelling problem statement specifically situated in the field of HRD.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n33\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the fourth paragraph (Line 29-50, Page 2) in the introduction section repeats the concerns and challenges of PA, circling back to the initial point in the third paragraph.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n34\nreviewer1\nFurthermore, on Page 2, Lines 3-6, it is stated, \"Despite these concerns, the PA scholar community has established some consensus about terms and methods.\" However, the statement is followed by a list of different PA-related terms while did not exemplify any PA methods. I recommend that the authors cite Yoon (2018, 2021) as mentioned in the second paragraph to provide examples of common PA methods to provide supporting information to the statement.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n35\nreviewer1\nIn the last paragraph of the introduction section, there is a limited discussion of the methods employed. I recommend that the authors develop a standalone method section to provide more detailed explanations of the methods used in the study. This will enable readers to understand how the measures were computed, interpret the reported matrices, and comprehend how the study arrived at its findings.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n36\nreviewer1\nIn Line 34-35, Page 5, it is stated, \"After the third round, a total of 173 articles were retrieved.\" However, the authors did not provide sufficient information regarding the process followed in each round, including the criteria used for inclusion/exclusion and the specific method of reviewing the articles to make selection decisions. The authors should outline the steps taken in each round to allow readers to better understand the selection process and evaluate the reliability and validity of the data collection process.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n37\nreviewer1\nIn the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section, starting from Page 6, Line 45, the authors provide a descriptive analysis of the data related to authors, journals, and geographical origin of the selected articles. To enhance the organization and clarity of presentation, I recommend that the authors create subheadings for each of these aspects.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 11,12,13\nNA\n\n\n38\nreviewer1\nRegarding the analysis of geographical distribution, it is important to clarify the language criteria used for selecting the articles. If the articles were restricted to a specific language, such as English, it is possible that the analysis may not represent the actual level of interest from different countries. It may underestimate the representation of countries where English is not the primary language for scholarly publications.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 12\nNA\n\n\n39\nreviewer1\nFor topic modeling, I suggest the authors provide the number of articles related to each identified topic. It can help readers gain a better understanding of the relative importance and coverage of different topics and themes in the literature.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 15\nNA\n\n\n40\nreviewer1\nFor clustering analysis, it would be helpful for the authors to include a measure of purity to assess the performance and validity of the clustering model.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 16\nNA\n\n\n41\nreviewer1\nMoreover, in addition to the previous point, the authors should provide a clear explanation of how the centrality and impact of the clusters were measured (Table 3), specifying the specific centrality metric(s) employed in their analysis, for example, is it based on degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, or eigenvector centrality?\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 17\nNA\n\n\n42\nreviewer1\nIf bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering can also identify topics and themes and even provide quantifiable measures, why topic modeling analysis is needed? Do they tell different stories or do the two analyses results converge? The authors should provide a justification for the selection of topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering. It is important to clarify whether these different analyses tell distinct stories or if their results converge.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 18,19\nNA\n\n\n43\nreviewer1\nIn Line 24-27, Page 21, it is mentioned, \"There is a growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytical approaches in the HRD scholar community.\" However, the stand-out theme related to AI was not mentioned in the findings section.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n44\nreviewer1\nIn Line 40-45, Page 21, it is mentioned that the current summary does not include any related HRD articles published in the four HRD journals sponsored by the Academy of Human Resource Development. I would like to refer you to a recently published article by Ratnam & Devi (2023) in HRDI: Ratnam, D. S., & Devi, V. R. (2023).

The authors can present a comprehensive landscape by highlighting the clusters/themes that align with HRD research and practice. This can be done by providing a summary of each relevant cluster/theme and explaining how it relates to HRD. For example, if a cluster/theme is focused on training and development practices in organizations, it can be highlighted as relevant to HRD's role in facilitating learning and skill development.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n46\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the authors can compare the findings of their study with the results of Yoon & Chae (2022) to identify any overlapping clusters/themes or areas of convergence. This can provide insights into the consistency or divergence of findings across different studies, enriching the understanding of the PA landscape in the context of HRD: Yoon, S. W., & Chae, C.

    "section": "Analytic Procedure",
    "text": "Analytic Procedure\n\nWe will anonymize all the 200 interviews data (transcripts) collected and create metadata information including: interview participant numbers (2015-1 to 2015-18, 2016-1 to 2016-50, 2017-1 to 2017-19, 2018-1 to 2018-21, 2019-1 to 2019-15, 2020-1 to 2020-3, 2021-1 to 2021-23, 2022-1 to 2022-50), participants’ industries/fields, positions, years of work, the number of children, and family support. This anonymized metadata information will be used to compare emerged patterns of woman in leadership by demographic attributes only.\nThe topic modeling method will be applied to a few sample interviews data before determining the fit of the topic modeling method to all interviews data. If there is missing information in the metadata information, we will discuss about how to fill the gap and proceed.\nWhen we reach consensus, the topic modeling method will be applied to all interviews data using computational techniques (see the data analysis plan below).\nAs the results of the computational process are generated, all researchers will discuss about the validity and credibility of the results from topic modeling, and to do so, findings from previous eight studies will be compared. Five researchers who had participated in all or some qualitative studies and two researchers who didn’t will go through the validation process, and in the process, we will identify key research topics on women leaders in South Korea. Through using the topic modeling method which is a computational approach to unstructured qualitative data collected, we aim to identify hidden research topics that we could not find using qualitative research methods only. Combining computational and interpretive approaches in the process of using topic modeling, we will provide much more unbiased, reliable, and reproducible research topics that will open the possibility for uncharted future investigation and implications for practice.\n\nThe data analysis process is comprised of four primary steps: data collection and restructuring, data cleanup, preprocessing, and modeling. First, in the data collection and restructuring phase, the 200 interview transcripts will be converted to text files. For the reframing procedure, transformed interview transcripts will be saved in an Excel file using the data frame format. We will create a separate cell for interview questions. In the data frame, an interviewee’s answer will be separated into paragraph units, and then the information of the interviewee that has been anonymized will be matched with interview questions. This process is essential for determining the unit of analysis in topic modeling. The second step is data cleanup. R (statistic software for text mining) will be loaded with a data frame containing the metadata of interviewees, interview questions, and responses. In the process of data cleanup, data validation verifies the datapoint’s type and identifies any missing data. Third, In comparison to typical qualitative and quantitative data, text mining’s pre-processing is the most distinctive procedure. In this pre-processing phase, the text of our target data will be turned into a corpus of electronic text documents for analysis. In this step, n-gram (generating a list of one word, two words, etc.), stop words (words that provide little information for modeling (i.e., a, an, the, and. . . ), and part-of-speech tags are examined to construct a word list (tokenizing). Lastly, in the modeling stage, a structured topic modeling (STM) based on the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) method will be performed using information, such as corpus, word list (token), and metadata generated in the pre-processing stage. Topic modeling returns a series of word lists for each topic (the number of topics will be specified) and each topic’s occurrence probability. It also provides multiple selection criteria for optimal numbers of topics for us to evaluate. Using the final model, researchers will label topics and describe them based on co-appearance of keywords within and across topics to summarize the entire text"

By applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we were able to exclude 14 items, which consisted of 5 book reviews, 6 editorial materials, 1 letter, 1 book review early access, and 1 editorial material early access. Consequently, we were left with 159 research articles, which accounted for approximately 79% of the total articles, 13% of the early access articles, 9% of the reviews, and 3% of the early access reviews. These articles primarily consisted of publications in the form of articles and reviews.\n\n\n9\neditor\nDetail the process of article selection, including inclusion/exclusion criteria and rounds of selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n10\neditor\nSpecify the steps taken in each round for article selection.\nMetnod\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nNA\nA figure explain search term evaluation procedure added\nfigure1\n\n\n11\neditor\nYou may move the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section to the method section with a different title because it is as if you described the sample.\nAnalytics\nRevise\nMove to method section\nNA\nNA\napplied\nWhole section moved under method\n\n\n12\neditor\nIn addition, consider condensing the description in this section.

This means that our search specifically targeted literature written in the English language.\nFirst, we started a preliminary search using seed keywords related to analytics, assessments, and measurement of people in organizational contexts that written in English.\n\n\n15\neditor\nProvide the number of articles related to each topic identified\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nThe LDA/STM topic model is a useful tool for uncovering hidden topics within articles by utilizing probability calculations. It determines the likelihood of multiple dominant topics appearing in an article and calculates the probability of each identified topic occurring throughout the article. However, it is currently not feasible to accurately determine the exact number of articles related to each specific topic. In the best-case scenario, we can potentially provide suggestions regarding the top five dominant topics per article or identify the dominant topic that exceeds a certain occurrence probability threshold. Nevertheless, it's important to note that the distribution of probabilities for some topics may be heavily skewed. Furthermore, there is no widely agreed-upon consensus or established method for determining the appropriate threshold level to apply in these suggestions.\nNA\n\n\n16\neditor\nInclude a measure of purity for the clustering model\nAnalytics\nResponse\nNA\nChad\nNA\nPurity measures, which are commonly used in supervised machine learning approaches with benchmark datasets, typically rely on mutual information. These measures are particularly employed in tree regression and clustering methods. However, when it comes to hierarchical clustering, which is a distance-based clustering approach, purity measures are not commonly utilized. Instead, other evaluation measures such as the elbow method, average silhouette method, and gap statistic method are considered more suitable for assessing hierarchical clustering. Additionally, no bibliometrics study to date has reported on the usage of these evaluation measures. Therefore, in addition to considering the characteristics of the special issue and journal, there arises a question as to whether we should include information about these evaluation methods and their corresponding processes in our report.\nNA\n\n\n17\neditor\nExplain how centrality and impact of clusters were measured and specify the centrality metrics used\nAnalytics\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd explanation in note for the figure\nThe x-axis represents the cluster centrality, which is measured using Callon's Centrality index. On the other hand, the y-axis represents the cluster impact, which is measured using the Mean Normalized Local Citation Score (MNLCS). The Normalized Local Citation Score (NLCS) of a document is determined by dividing the actual count of citations from local sources by the expected citation rate for documents published in the same year. This calculation allows for a fair comparison of citation impact across different documents, accounting for the varying expected citation rates based on the publication year.\nNA\n\n\n18\neditor\nClarify the reasons for selecting topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd contents about why we applied three method\nWhen conducting a scoping review, topic modeling, bibliocoupling, and hierarchical clustering are essential techniques, each providing a unique lens to comprehend and organize a large body of literature. Topic modeling, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), is a statistical model that identifies the \"topics\" of a collection of documents. In the context of a scoping review, it is crucial to distinguish the predominant themes across the selected literature. Typically, a scoping review aims to assess the scope and depth of the existing literature on a specific topic. Utilizing topic modeling, researchers can efficiently highlight key themes and trends. Bibliocoupling, which assesses the relatedness between articles based on their shared references, complements topic modeling. This technique enables researchers to identify clusters of closely related articles, which they can then analyze to determine the subtopics or themes they represent. By identifying segments of literature that share references during a scoping review, researchers can infer that these groups may be addressing similar research questions or topics, thereby establishing a deeper level of comprehension. Hierarchical clustering offers a way to organize the identified themes or topics visually. As a type of cluster analysis, it seeks to construct a hierarchy of clusters by providing a visual representation, such as a dendrogram, of the relationships between various research themes. By employing this methodology, researchers can comprehend the intricate relationships between various fields of study and identify overarching themes or trends. Consequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature. With topic modeling illuminating key themes, bibliocoupling demonstrating the relationship between various articles, and hierarchical clustering visually representing the relationship between themes, researchers can gain an in-depth comprehension of the current state of research in a particular field. Combining these techniques provides an integrative method for comprehending the nuances and particulars of a particular field of study.\nNA\n\n\n19\neditor\nExplain whether these analyses are complementary or convergent\nAnalytical Techniques\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nexplained in issue ID 18\nConsequently, integrating these three methods in a scoping review provides a comprehensive, systematic approach to dissecting and organizing vast amounts of literature.

Combining these techniques provides an integrative method for comprehending the nuances and particulars of a particular field of study.\nNA\n\n\n20\neditor\nInclude recent articles relevant to HRD, such as Ratnam & Devi (2023)\nAnalytical Techniques\n??\nNA\nYoon\nIs it really necessary? Considering the literature that the editor suggest, I can't find any contribution or reason to add\nNA\nNA\n\n\n21\neditor\nFor readers who may not be familiar with technical terms, please kindly explain what some numbers mean (e.g., K=20 on p. 9).\nFindings\nRevise\nNA\nChad\nAdd explanation\nWhen determining the optimal number of topics (K), ~ The data suggested that a balance between these factors is achieved at K=20 (a model with 20 topics).\nNA\n\n\n22\neditor\nMap the identified clusters/themes to portray the landscape for PA in HRD. You have 20 topics that are grouped into four themes as well as 7 clusters. What do they do for HRD practice and research? There seems to be a lack of justification for having both. If it was to triangulate the findings, there needs to be a synthesized discussion.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n23\neditor\nHighlight clusters/themes relevant to HRD research AND practice.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n24\neditor\nCompare findings with other studies (e.g., Yoon & Chae, 2022) to identify convergences or divergences.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n25\neditor\nThis study may give some guidance for HRD and PA research relevant to HRD. However, it is difficult to envision how the findings can be useful for HRD practice. Although you discussed some implications for HRD practice, the core content is not based on the main findings. This is a critical challenge.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n26\neditor\nCreate the limitations section and address limitations along with its delimitation and methodological limitations\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n27\neditor\nSplit the “Implications for Future Research and Practice” section into “Implications for HRD Research,” “Implications for HRD Practice,” “Study Limitations,” and “Recommendations for Future Research.”\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n28\neditor\nYou proposed what PA should focus on. Please make it clear that your proposal is based on the findings and sufficiently covers the scope of HRD. Organizational effectiveness or organization development-related domains seem to be missing. This leads us to believe that perhaps leaving out the definitions of PA might be necessary.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n29\neditor\nWhy do you need the definitions along with the new one to achieve the purpose of this study? How is it relevant to the research purpose or the RQs? You might need to introduce some of them in the introduction section in a concise manner.\nDiscussion\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n30\neditor\nAddress APA format issues as Reviewer 1 raised. In addition, italicize the journal titles.\nAPA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n31\neditor\nClearly articulate the significance of your work and how it advances the field of HRD (see Reviewer 2’s comments and item #1 above.)\nETC\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n32\nreviewer1\nI believe that there is a need for this research topic to explore the boundaries and scope of PA research in HRD. However, the introduction section fails to effectively narrow down the research focus and establish a compelling problem statement for conducting this research in the field of HRD. ~~ However, the third paragraph (from Line 51-55 on Page 1 to Line 3-27 on Page 2) introduces diverse while disconnected points. It starts by removing the context and addressing concerns mainly about PA, then introduces different terms related to PA and argues for the need to clarify the definition of PA. This need, though, is not directly tied to the research question but is later addressed in the discussion section. The third paragraph concludes by mentioning increasing emphasis of PA in “HRM.” The context switch is indeed abrupt and disrupts the logical flow of the text. I suggest that the author reorganize these points to develop a coherent logical flow and frame a compelling problem statement specifically situated in the field of HRD.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n33\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the fourth paragraph (Line 29-50, Page 2) in the introduction section repeats the concerns and challenges of PA, circling back to the initial point in the third paragraph.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n34\nreviewer1\nFurthermore, on Page 2, Lines 3-6, it is stated, \"Despite these concerns, the PA scholar community has established some consensus about terms and methods.\" However, the statement is followed by a list of different PA-related terms while did not exemplify any PA methods. I recommend that the authors cite Yoon (2018, 2021) as mentioned in the second paragraph to provide examples of common PA methods to provide supporting information to the statement.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n35\nreviewer1\nIn the last paragraph of the introduction section, there is a limited discussion of the methods employed. I recommend that the authors develop a standalone method section to provide more detailed explanations of the methods used in the study. This will enable readers to understand how the measures were computed, interpret the reported matrices, and comprehend how the study arrived at its findings.\nIntroduction\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n36\nreviewer1\nIn Line 34-35, Page 5, it is stated, \"After the third round, a total of 173 articles were retrieved.\" However, the authors did not provide sufficient information regarding the process followed in each round, including the criteria used for inclusion/exclusion and the specific method of reviewing the articles to make selection decisions. The authors should outline the steps taken in each round to allow readers to better understand the selection process and evaluate the reliability and validity of the data collection process.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nInclusion and exclusion criteria added\nThe fundamental principle of our inclusion criteria is to select research articles that are relevant to HR (Human Resources) and people analytics, and specifically focus on applied elements that are of concern to HRD (Human Resource Development). We defined our inclusion criteria through a combination of carefully chosen keywords. During the screening process, we made the decision to exclude supplementary formats such as front matter, which includes elements like prefaces or acknowledgments. Furthermore, we chose to include only research articles, which resulted in the exclusion of book reviews, editorial materials, and letters.\n\n\n37\nreviewer1\nIn the \"Structural and Compositional Characteristics of PA Research\" section, starting from Page 6, Line 45, the authors provide a descriptive analysis of the data related to authors, journals, and geographical origin of the selected articles. To enhance the organization and clarity of presentation, I recommend that the authors create subheadings for each of these aspects.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 11,12,13\nNA\n\n\n38\nreviewer1\nRegarding the analysis of geographical distribution, it is important to clarify the language criteria used for selecting the articles. If the articles were restricted to a specific language, such as English, it is possible that the analysis may not represent the actual level of interest from different countries. It may underestimate the representation of countries where English is not the primary language for scholarly publications.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 12\nNA\n\n\n39\nreviewer1\nFor topic modeling, I suggest the authors provide the number of articles related to each identified topic. It can help readers gain a better understanding of the relative importance and coverage of different topics and themes in the literature.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 15\nNA\n\n\n40\nreviewer1\nFor clustering analysis, it would be helpful for the authors to include a measure of purity to assess the performance and validity of the clustering model.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 16\nNA\n\n\n41\nreviewer1\nMoreover, in addition to the previous point, the authors should provide a clear explanation of how the centrality and impact of the clusters were measured (Table 3), specifying the specific centrality metric(s) employed in their analysis, for example, is it based on degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, or eigenvector centrality?\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 17\nNA\n\n\n42\nreviewer1\nIf bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering can also identify topics and themes and even provide quantifiable measures, why topic modeling analysis is needed? Do they tell different stories or do the two analyses results converge? The authors should provide a justification for the selection of topic modeling analysis alongside bibliocoupling and hierarchical clustering. It is important to clarify whether these different analyses tell distinct stories or if their results converge.\nMethod\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nCovered by ID 18,19\nNA\n\n\n43\nreviewer1\nIn Line 24-27, Page 21, it is mentioned, \"There is a growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytical approaches in the HRD scholar community.\" However, the stand-out theme related to AI was not mentioned in the findings section.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n44\nreviewer1\nIn Line 40-45, Page 21, it is mentioned that the current summary does not include any related HRD articles published in the four HRD journals sponsored by the Academy of Human Resource Development.

The authors can present a comprehensive landscape by highlighting the clusters/themes that align with HRD research and practice. This can be done by providing a summary of each relevant cluster/theme and explaining how it relates to HRD. For example, if a cluster/theme is focused on training and development practices in organizations, it can be highlighted as relevant to HRD's role in facilitating learning and skill development.\nFindings\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n46\nreviewer1\nAdditionally, the authors can compare the findings of their study with the results of Yoon & Chae (2022) to identify any overlapping clusters/themes or areas of convergence. This can provide insights into the consistency or divergence of findings across different studies, enriching the understanding of the PA landscape in the context of HRD: Yoon, S. W., & Chae, C.

Let’s elaborate on the results, particularly focusing on the “authors’ production over time”:\n\nDescription\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\n\n\nLotka’s Law\nLotka’s Law is a fundamental principle in bibliometrics and scientometrics, which are fields concerned with the quantitative study of scientific and technological literature. Named after Alfred J. Lotka, who proposed the idea in 1926, this law describes the frequency with which authors publish in a particular field.\nLotka’s Law can be represented mathematically as:\n\\[ Y = \\frac{C} {X^{\\alpha}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n$ Y $ is the number of authors making $ X $ contributions\n$ C $ is a constant (it describes the number of authors making only one contribution)\n$ $ is a constant usually close to 2 (though it can vary depending on the discipline).\n\nInterpretation of Lotka’s Law:\n\nMajority Publishes Once: A large number of authors will have only one publication, which corresponds to the value of $ C $.\nDecrease in Frequency: As the number of publications per author (i.e., productivity) increases, the number of authors who have published that many times decreases, and this decrease is very sharp (often described as an inverse square law).\nFew Prolific Authors: Only a very small number of authors will be responsible for a large portion of the publications in a particular field. This can be thought of as the “80-20” principle, where a minority (often around 20%) of authors produce the majority (around 80%) of the work.\n\nApplication:\n\nIdentify Core Authors: By applying Lotka’s Law, organizations and researchers can identify the core authors or the most prolific contributors in a particular field or topic.\nAnalysis of Scientific Output: Lotka’s Law can be utilized to analyze the scientific output of a field, helping in recognizing the distribution of productivity among authors.\nResearch Evaluation: Research institutions might use this principle to evaluate the research output of their faculty or departments, understanding the distribution of prolific authors versus those who publish less frequently.\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that while Lotka’s Law provides a useful general observation about scientific productivity, there are variations depending on the specific scientific discipline or field of study. The values of $ C $ and $ alpha $ might differ across disciplines, and in some cases, other bibliometric models might offer a better fit to the data.\n\nMeasurement for the Lotka’s law is the following:\n\nN.Articles: This is the number of articles written by an author.\nN.Authors: This is the number of authors who have written the corresponding N.Articles.\nFreq: This is the frequency (proportion) of those authors relative to the total number of authors.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\n\n\nAuthors’ Local Impact\n\nThe followings are the measurement of the local impact\n\nElement: Name of the author.\nh_index: h-index of the author, which represents the maximum number of articles an author has written that have received at least the same number of citations.\ng_index: g-index of the author, a metric that takes into account the distribution of citations received by a researcher’s publications.\nm_index: Rate of acquiring h-index points. It is calculated by dividing the h-index by the number of years since the first published paper of the author.\nTC: Total citations the author has received.\nNP: Number of publications by the author.\nPY_start: The year of the author’s first publication.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliations\n\nMost Relevant Affiliations\nThe data provided is a bibliometric analysis focusing on the affiliations that have contributed to research related to psychological entitlement.

This spectrum can give insight into the foundational works for that paper or topic, indicating which previous works are most influential or relevant.\nAnalysis: By examining the “spectra” (or citation patterns) of multiple papers or topics, one can identify trends, clusters, and gaps in the research landscape. This is analogous to how one might use spectroscopy to categorize and analyze different materials based on their spectral signatures.\nEvolution Over Time: Just as the spectrum of a star can tell us about its age and stage in the lifecycle, looking at the changing citation patterns or “spectra” over time can reveal how a field or topic has evolved. It can show which works have become foundational over time or which ones have fallen out of favor.\nIntensity & Peaks: In physical spectroscopy, the intensity of certain peaks in a spectrum can indicate the concentration of specific elements or compounds. Similarly, in bibliometrics, certain references might be cited much more frequently than others, indicating their centrality or importance to the field. These “peaks” in the citation spectrum can point to seminal works or pivotal authors in a domain.\nComparative Analysis: By comparing the “spectra” of different papers, topics, or even researchers, one can identify overlaps, synergies, and distinctions. This can be useful for interdisciplinary research, collaboration opportunities, or understanding the landscape of a broad field.\nAnomalies & Outliers: Sometimes, a spectrum will have unexpected peaks or features. In bibliometrics, unexpected citation patterns might indicate emerging areas of interest, interdisciplinary bridges, or even issues like citation cartels or excessive self-citation.\nApplication: Just as spectroscopy has practical applications in material identification, quality control, and more, bibliometric “spectroscopy” can be used for research evaluation, funding allocation, curriculum design, and other academic or research management tasks.\n\nIn essence, the concept of “References Spectroscopy” in bibliometrics is a metaphorical way of describing the deep analysis of citation patterns to understand the structure, evolution, and dynamics of scholarly research.\nThe “Reference publication year spectroscopy” (RPYS) is a method to analyze the age of cited references in a given publication set. It can reveal the seminal works and foundational literature within a topic or domain.

Of these, 146 are authors of single-authored documents, and there are 160 single-authored documents.\n\nThe average Co-Authors per Document is 3.02, showing moderate teamwork on publications.\n\n39.73% of the documents involve international co-authorship, highlighting a significant level of global collaboration.\n\nDocument Types:\n\nThe majority are articles (1359), followed by:\n\narticle; early access: 124\n\nreview: 60\n\nreview; early access: 6\n\nSmaller numbers for proceedings papers, editorial material, and one retracted publication.\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe robust annual growth rate (12.59%) from 1992 to 2025 reflects an expanding research area, with increasing numbers of publications.\n\nThe relatively young average age (4.37 years) of the documents implies that the field is actively publishing new studies or is experiencing a surge of recent interest.\n\nA high average citation rate (30.05) points to the significance or influence of these studies, indicating that the research outputs are resonating within the scholarly community.\n\nThe large number of references (70,323) suggests that authors are building upon extensive prior knowledge, indicative of a well-established research base.\n\nCollaboration metrics:\n\nAn average of 3.02 co-authors per document indicates moderate teamwork among researchers.\n\n39.73% international co-authorship underscores a noteworthy global dimension to this research area, suggesting both the relevance and collaborative nature of the topic.\n\n\nThe predominance of articles shows that the main mode of dissemination is through empirical or theoretical research papers, while the presence of reviews (66 in total) indicates ongoing efforts to synthesize existing knowledge.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nOverall, these findings reveal a dynamically growing field with a steady increase in publications over the past few decades. High citation averages and a diverse, global collaborative network underscore the field’s academic importance. The dominance of articles among document types and the variety in keywords highlight broad research engagement and topical exploration.\nIn summary, the field demonstrates strong growth, collaborative spirit, and robust impact in terms of citation—signaling a vibrant and evolving scholarly community.\n\n\nAnnual Scientific Production\n\nDescription\n\n\nGradual Emergence (1992–2005):\nThe number of articles is very low in the early years, ranging from 0 to 2 per year, with a small uptick to 5 in 2006.\nSteady Uptick (2006–2015):\nFrom 2006 onward, there is a gradual climb in publications:\n\n5 articles in 2006\n\n10 articles by 2010\n\n29 articles by 2015\n\nSignificant Surge (2016–2024):\nThe publication count shows a substantial rise during this period:\n\n53 articles in 2016\n\n98 in 2019\n\n142 in 2020\n\n191 in 2022\n\n342 in 2024\n\nPartial Data or Drop in 2025:\nAfter a record high in 2024 (342 articles), the count is 50 in 2025, which might indicate data for 2025 is incomplete or still being collected.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nGrowing Research Interest:\nThe rise from single-digit publications in the early 2000s to over 300 in 2024 highlights increasing global interest and research efforts in this field or topic.\nAccelerating Publication Rate:\nThe jump from 2015 to 2024 suggests not just incremental growth but an accelerating pace of output, possibly due to:\n\nIncreased funding or recognition of the field’s importance\n\nMore collaborative networks and open-access channels\n\nOngoing technological or theoretical breakthroughs leading to higher publication productivity\n\nFluctuation in Latest Year (2025):\nThe sharp decline to 50 articles in 2025 likely reflects partial data for the year. If the pattern holds, the final count for 2025 may approach or exceed previous totals once data collection is complete.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nIn summary, the annual scientific production has shown a marked upward trajectory over the past decades, reflecting growing engagement and collaboration in this research area. The lower 2025 figure is likely due to incomplete data rather than a genuine downturn. Overall, the trend underscores a maturing field with increasing scholarly attention and output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nArticles\n\n\n\n\n1992\n1\n\n\n1993\n0\n\n\n1994\n0\n\n\n1995\n1\n\n\n1996\n1\n\n\n1997\n0\n\n\n1998\n0\n\n\n1999\n0\n\n\n2000\n0\n\n\n2001\n1\n\n\n2002\n1\n\n\n2003\n2\n\n\n2004\n2\n\n\n2005\n1\n\n\n2006\n5\n\n\n2007\n2\n\n\n2008\n8\n\n\n2009\n9\n\n\n2010\n10\n\n\n2011\n11\n\n\n2012\n18\n\n\n2013\n25\n\n\n2014\n24\n\n\n2015\n29\n\n\n2016\n53\n\n\n2017\n65\n\n\n2018\n58\n\n\n2019\n98\n\n\n2020\n142\n\n\n2021\n162\n\n\n2022\n191\n\n\n2023\n241\n\n\n2024\n342\n\n\n2025\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Citations per Year\n\nDescription\n\n\nMean Total Citations per Article (MeanTCperArt):\n\nHigher values appear in earlier years (e.g., 178 in 1996, 195 in 2004), while more recent years show much lower values (e.g., 3.13 in 2024, 1.44 in 2025).\n\nThis reflects the longer timespan older articles have had to accumulate citations.\n\nNumber of Articles (N):\n\nSparse in the early years (often 1 or 2 articles).\n\nSubstantial increase in later years, with 342 articles in 2024 and 50 in 2025 (notable jump compared to single digits in the 1990s).\n\nMean Citations per Year (MeanTCperYear):\n\nFluctuates from 2.88 (1992) to peaks around 8.86 (2004) and 8.14 (2011).\n\nGenerally, older articles show higher mean citations per year, likely indicating influential or foundational research.\n\nCitable Years:\n\nThe table shows a gradually decreasing number of citable years as the publication date moves closer to the present (e.g., 34 citable years for 1992 vs. 1 for 2025).\n\nThis aligns with the notion that newer articles simply haven’t had as much time to be cited.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nInfluence of Older Publications:\nArticles from the 1990s and early 2000s show high average citations, suggesting they may be seminal works or foundational studies that have consistently been cited over decades.\nCitation Accumulation Over Time:\nThe longer an article has been available, the more citations it tends to accumulate. Hence, recent publications (especially post-2020) naturally exhibit lower citation counts and lower mean citation rates.\nRapid Growth of Publications:\nA significant increase in the number of articles in the 2010s and early 2020s indicates expanding research activity. More scholars entering the field and greater research funding can lead to a higher volume of new work, though these new papers typically need time to garner citations.\nDisparities in Citation Rates:\nSome specific years (e.g., 1996, 2004) show unusually high average citations, possibly indicating particularly influential articles published in those years.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nIn summary, older publications have accrued more citations and thus show higher average totals and yearly citation rates. Meanwhile, the volume of recent publications has grown substantially, but these newer papers have had less time to gather citations. Consequently, the dataset shows a maturing field where both the quantity of research and the range of citation impacts continue to expand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nMeanTCperArt\nN\nMeanTCperYear\nCitableYears\n\n\n\n\n1992\n98.00\n1\n2.88\n34\n\n\n1995\n83.00\n1\n2.68\n31\n\n\n1996\n178.00\n1\n5.93\n30\n\n\n2001\n41.00\n1\n1.64\n25\n\n\n2002\n39.00\n1\n1.62\n24\n\n\n2003\n59.50\n2\n2.59\n23\n\n\n2004\n195.00\n2\n8.86\n22\n\n\n2005\n25.00\n1\n1.19\n21\n\n\n2006\n94.00\n5\n4.70\n20\n\n\n2007\n140.50\n2\n7.39\n19\n\n\n2008\n146.38\n8\n8.13\n18\n\n\n2009\n89.89\n9\n5.29\n17\n\n\n2010\n86.30\n10\n5.39\n16\n\n\n2011\n122.09\n11\n8.14\n15\n\n\n2012\n82.22\n18\n5.87\n14\n\n\n2013\n106.88\n25\n8.22\n13\n\n\n2014\n82.21\n24\n6.85\n12\n\n\n2015\n74.97\n29\n6.82\n11\n\n\n2016\n77.38\n53\n7.74\n10\n\n\n2017\n66.32\n65\n7.37\n9\n\n\n2018\n51.64\n58\n6.46\n8\n\n\n2019\n48.71\n98\n6.96\n7\n\n\n2020\n35.70\n142\n5.95\n6\n\n\n2021\n29.99\n162\n6.00\n5\n\n\n2022\n14.62\n191\n3.65\n4\n\n\n2023\n10.05\n241\n3.35\n3\n\n\n2024\n3.13\n342\n1.56\n2\n\n\n2025\n1.44\n50\n1.44\n1"

These include specialized outlets (e.g., Journal of Ecotourism, Tourist Studies) and multidisciplinary journals that occasionally cover tourism themes (e.g., European Sport Management Quarterly, Sport in Society).\n\nA handful of publications feature only 1 or 2 articles, likely representing specialized or newer outlets.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nDominance of Core Tourism Journals:\nThe top five clearly include major tourism research outlets, underscoring their leadership and high visibility in the field. Their prominence indicates that they are go-to journals for scholars seeking to disseminate influential work.\nDiverse Publication Platforms:\nThe broad spread of journals, from dedicated tourism/hospitality outlets to interdisciplinary publications (e.g., International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching, Sport Management Review), reflects the multidisciplinary nature of tourism research. Scholars engage with tourism in relation to hospitality, recreation, heritage, and sports, indicating cross-field collaboration.\nGlobal and Niche Perspectives:\nJournals such as Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research highlight regional focuses, while others (e.g., Tourism Geographies, Tourist Studies) emphasize specific thematic or methodological lenses. This diversity shows the field’s richness and its multiple research avenues.\nEmerging or Specialized Outlets:\nOutlets with fewer articles likely represent emerging journals, specialized niches, or newly indexed publications. They can still be influential within particular subfields or geographic contexts.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nOverall, Tourism Management, Journal of Travel Research, and Journal of Sustainable Tourism head the list, illustrating their central roles in the dissemination of tourism scholarship. The breadth of titles confirms the multidisciplinary, global scope of research in tourism and hospitality, encompassing both highly specialized and more general outlets.\nIn summary, these data underscore the core journals that carry the bulk of tourism research output, as well as the growing ecosystem of specialized or interdisciplinary publications contributing to the field.\n\n\nMost Local Cited Sources\n\nDescription\n\n\nTop-Tier Citations:\n\nTourism Management (TOURISM MANAGE) tops the list with 7,488 local citations, followed by\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research (ANN TOURISM RES) with 7,041,\n\nJournal of Travel Research entries combined (abbreviated as J TRAVEL RES = 3,793 and spelled out as JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH = 1,589) total over 5,300 citations if considered together,\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism also appears twice (J SUSTAIN TOUR = 2,411 and JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM = 423), suggesting a large overall impact.\n\nKey Tourism and Hospitality Outlets:\nBesides the highest-cited titles above, other influential journals include Current Issues in Tourism (CURR ISSUES TOUR = 1,709), International Journal of Hospitality Management (1,682), International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management (1,311), and Tourism Management Perspectives (1,088).\nInterdisciplinary and Methodological Sources:\nNoteworthy entries from broader disciplines include:\n\nJournal of Business Research (1,152)\n\nSocial Indicators Research (726)\n\nPsychological Bulletin (519)\n\nMultivariate Data Analysis: A Global Perspective (240)\n\nStructural Equation Modeling (115)\n\nScience (107)\nThese highlight cross-disciplinary influences and methodological underpinnings within tourism research.\n\nDiverse Topic Coverage:\nSeveral other psychology or marketing journals, like Journal of Consumer Research, Journal of Applied Psychology, and Journal of Marketing, each exceed 400 local citations. There is also representation from sustainability (Sustainability-Basel, 971; Ecological Economics, 155), indicating an environmental focus within tourism research.\nOverlap in Abbreviated vs. Full Journal Titles:\nSome journals appear under both abbreviated and full titles (e.g., J TRAVEL RES and JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH), artificially splitting their total citations.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCentral Role of Specialized Tourism Journals:\n\nThe dominance of Tourism Management and Annals of Tourism Research confirms their status as leading authorities in tourism scholarship.\n\nWhen combined, different listings for Journal of Travel Research and Journal of Sustainable Tourism confirm they also command high local citations, placing them squarely among the discipline’s core references.\n\nSignificance of Interdisciplinary Support:\n\nThe presence of business, psychology, and sustainability journals (e.g., Journal of Business Research, Psychological Bulletin, Sustainability-Basel) underscores the multidisciplinary nature of tourism studies.\n\nResearchers frequently draw on marketing and psychological theories, as well as sustainability frameworks, to inform tourism-based inquiries.\n\nMethodological Foundation:\n\nCitations to Multivariate Data Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling reflect that quantitative, rigorous statistical approaches are widely employed in tourism research, emphasizing sophisticated analysis techniques.\n\nPossibility of Citation Inflation via Duplicate Entries:\n\nSome journals (e.g., J TRAVEL RES vs. JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH) appear twice, indicating that aggregated citations would be higher if merged.\n\nThis duplication suggests that authors may cite the same source using different abbreviations, reflecting standard inconsistencies in bibliographic data.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nOverall, Tourism Management, Annals of Tourism Research, and Journal of Travel Research (in both abbreviated and full forms) are at the forefront, reflecting their longstanding influence. The dataset also shows a broad interdisciplinary reach, with high citation counts for psychology, business, and sustainability journals. Further, the usage of advanced research methods is evident, pointing to a mature and methodologically robust field.\nIn summary, these citation patterns underscore the central role of leading tourism journals, the cross-disciplinary integrations shaping the field, and the methodological depth that tourism scholars employ in their research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources\nArticles\n\n\n\n\nTOURISM MANAGE\n7488\n\n\nANN TOURISM RES\n7041\n\n\nJ TRAVEL RES\n3793\n\n\nJ SUSTAIN TOUR\n2411\n\n\nCURR ISSUES TOUR\n1709\n\n\nINT J HOSP MANAG\n1682\n\n\nJOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH\n1589\n\n\nINT J CONTEMP HOSP M\n1311\n\n\nJ TRAVEL TOUR MARK\n1221\n\n\nJ BUS RES\n1152\n\n\nTOUR MANAG PERSPECT\n1088\n\n\nINT J TOUR RES\n1066\n\n\nSUSTAINABILITY-BASEL\n971\n\n\nJ HOSP TOUR MANAG\n913\n\n\nJ DESTIN MARK MANAGE\n897\n\n\nJ PERS SOC PSYCHOL\n850\n\n\nJ HOSP TOUR RES\n780\n\n\nTOURISM GEOGR\n732\n\n\nSOC INDIC RES\n726\n\n\nTOUR REV\n658\n\n\nASIA PAC J TOUR RES\n639\n\n\nJ HAPPINESS STUD\n576\n\n\nJ MARKETING RES\n541\n\n\nJ LEISURE RES\n529\n\n\nTOUR RECREAT RES\n525\n\n\nPSYCHOL BULL\n519\n\n\nJ HOSP MARKET MANAG\n509\n\n\nLEISURE SCI\n486\n\n\nJ CONSUM RES\n481\n\n\nJ ENVIRON PSYCHOL\n479\n\n\nJ APPL PSYCHOL\n455\n\n\nTOUR ANAL\n445\n\n\nJOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM\n423\n\n\nJ MARKETING\n403\n\n\nAM PSYCHOL\n383\n\n\nJ ACAD MARKET SCI\n348\n\n\nSCAND J HOSP TOUR\n341\n\n\nINT J ENV RES PUB HE\n332\n\n\nTOURISM ECON\n318\n\n\nLEISURE STUD\n305\n\n\nFRONT PSYCHOL\n304\n\n\nJ RETAIL CONSUM SERV\n298\n\n\nTOUR PLAN DEV\n285\n\n\nAPPL RES QUAL LIFE\n277\n\n\nANATOLIA\n276\n\n\nTOUR HOSP RES\n271\n\n\nANNU REV PSYCHOL\n267\n\n\nSERV IND J\n253\n\n\nMULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE\n240\n\n\nJ VACAT MARK\n233\n\n\nPERS INDIV DIFFER\n233\n\n\nJOURNAL OF VACATION MARKETING\n229\n\n\nANN LEIS RES\n227\n\n\nCOMPUT HUM BEHAV\n220\n\n\nJ CLEAN PROD\n216\n\n\nEVENT MANAGEMENT\n210\n\n\nPSYCHOL MARKET\n205\n\n\nJ BUS ETHICS\n203\n\n\nJOURNAL OF TRAVEL & TOURISM MARKETING\n199\n\n\nJ MANAGE\n196\n\n\nJ POSIT PSYCHOL\n190\n\n\nINT J TOUR CITIES\n189\n\n\nJ OUTDOOR REC TOUR\n189\n\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM\n185\n\n\nTOURISM\n180\n\n\nPLOS ONE\n178\n\n\nANNALS OF TOURISM RESEARCH\n176\n\n\nENVIRON BEHAV\n176\n\n\nEUR J TOUR RES\n176\n\n\nJ SERV RES-US\n170\n\n\nJ RETAILING\n169\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH\n164\n\n\nJ QUAL ASSUR HOSP TO\n164\n\n\nJ VOCAT BEHAV\n161\n\n\nSOC SCI MED\n161\n\n\nJ TOUR FUTURES\n159\n\n\nINT J CULT TOUR HOSP\n157\n\n\nECOL ECON\n155\n\n\nTHESIS\n151\n\n\nPSYCHOL SCI\n148\n\n\nJ TOUR CULT CHANGE\n147\n\n\nJ POLICY RES TOUR LE\n144\n\n\nACAD MANAGE REV\n143\n\n\nACAD MANAGE J\n142\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT\n141\n\n\nJ ORGAN BEHAV\n140\n\n\nJ PERS ASSESS\n140\n\n\nTOURISM TRIBUNE\n138\n\n\nJ HOSP TOUR INSIGHTS\n137\n\n\nJ CHINA TOUR RES\n135\n\n\nPROCD SOC BEHV\n135\n\n\nEUR J MARKETING\n134\n\n\nJ SERV MARK\n134\n\n\nINT J HOSP TOUR ADM\n131\n\n\nJ CONSUM PSYCHOL\n131\n\n\nINT J EVENT FESTIV M\n130\n\n\nTOURISM MANAGEMENT\n130\n\n\nMIS QUART\n127\n\n\nHARVARD BUS REV\n126\n\n\nJ HERIT TOUR\n124\n\n\nCORNELL HOSP Q\n122\n\n\nLEISURE STUDIES\n118\n\n\nTOUR REV INT\n118\n\n\nTOURIST STUD\n117\n\n\nSTRUCT EQU MODELING\n115\n\n\nHANDBOOK OF TOURISM AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE RESEARCH\n114\n\n\nWORLDW HOSP TOUR THE\n114\n\n\nLANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN\n111\n\n\nPERS SOC PSYCHOL B\n110\n\n\nASPEC TOUR\n108\n\n\nCITIES\n108\n\n\nPSYCHOMETRIC THEORY\n107\n\n\nSCIENCE\n107\n\n\nEVENT MANAGE\n106\n\n\nHEALTH PLACE\n104\n\n\nJ SERV MANAGE\n101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBradford’s Law\n\nDescription\n\n\nZonal Distribution: According to Bradford’s Law, the journals are divided into three zones:\n\nZone 1 (Core): Ranks 1–6, where each journal has the highest frequency of articles.\n\nZone 2: Ranks 7–19, which collectively contribute the next significant portion of articles.\n\nZone 3: Ranks 20–92, comprising the largest set of journals but each contributing fewer articles individually.\n\nZone 1 Journals (Ranks 1–6)\n\nTourism Management (108 articles)\n\nJournal of Travel Research (97)\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism (96)\n\nCurrent Issues in Tourism (90)\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research (73)\n\nInternational Journal of Tourism Research (69)\n\nTogether, they have a cumulative frequency of 533 articles. This comparatively small group accounts for a large share of the total documents, reflecting their high impact and centrality in the field.\nZone 2 Journals (Ranks 7–19)\n\nIncludes journals such as Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management (55 articles), Tourism Management Perspectives (51), and Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research (49).\n\nTheir cumulative frequency extends from 588 up to 1043, indicating they collectively represent another substantial fraction of the total publications.\n\nZone 3 Journals (Ranks 20–92)\n\nContains the majority of the listed journals (from Journal of Vacation Marketing at rank 20 to Sport Business and Management at rank 92).\n\nEach source contributes fewer articles, but in aggregate they form the largest zone, reflecting the breadth and diversity of niche or emerging outlets in tourism and hospitality research.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nClear Core Group:\nZone 1 journals (the top six) are widely recognized as key outlets in tourism research. Their high article frequencies signify their central role in disseminating foundational and cutting-edge studies.\nSecondary But Still Significant Contributors:\nZone 2 journals each have notable publication counts, reinforcing their status as important, although slightly less central, publication avenues. They often cater to particular subfields or combine tourism with other related disciplines (e.g., hospitality, recreation, or destination management).\nLong Tail in Zone 3:\nThe largest cluster includes many specialized or regional journals. While each has fewer publications, collectively they offer diverse perspectives and niche contributions to the field. This distribution aligns with Bradford’s Law, showing how research output is concentrated in a small number of core sources, with a wide array of additional journals making smaller but collectively significant contributions.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nBy applying Bradford’s Law, we see a high concentration of articles in a small group of journals (Zone 1), followed by a moderately sized set (Zone 2), and a broad “long tail” (Zone 3).\nIn summary, the data confirm that a few core journals (Tourism Management, Journal of Travel Research, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, etc.) dominate the field, while many other journals contribute essential but more specialized insights.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL\n92\n1\n1553\nZone 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources’ Local Impact\n\nDescription\n\n\nHigh-impact Leaders\n\nTourism Management (h-index = 54) stands out with the highest h-index, followed by Annals of Tourism Research (40) and Journal of Travel Research (40).\n\nThe g-index values follow a similar pattern, with Tourism Management (g = 98), Annals of Tourism Research (73), and Journal of Travel Research (74) at the forefront.\n\nTotal Citations (TC) and Number of Publications (NP)\n\nTourism Management again tops the list with 9,706 total citations across 108 publications, reflecting both volume and influence.\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research (TC = 6,712; NP = 73) and Journal of Travel Research (TC = 5,595; NP = 97) also show high visibility and citation impact.\n\nm-index (Years Normalized)\n\nTourism Management and Journal of Travel Research share a high m-index of 2.35, indicating that even when controlling for how long they’ve been publishing in this dataset (PY_start), they maintain strong citation momentum year over year.\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism (m = 1.89) also exhibits a robust rate of accumulating citations since 2008.\n\nEmerging or Specialized Journals\n\nMany journals further down the list have lower h-index and g-index scores (e.g., h-index &lt; 10). Some have relatively high m-index values despite lower absolute citation counts, indicating rapid growth within fewer years of publication history (e.g., Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management, h=18, m=1.8, started in 2016).\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCore Influence of Established Titles:\nThe highest h-index and g-index values cluster around long-standing, flagship tourism journals, confirming their role as core venues where influential and widely cited research is published.\nRole of Publication Timeline:\nThe m-index (which normalizes the h-index by publication years) reveals that newer outlets can still accumulate citations rapidly if they publish high-impact studies. For example, Tourism Management Perspectives (m = 2.09, started in 2015) has gained traction quickly, suggesting it’s an emerging high-impact venue.\nBreadth of Field Maturity:\nJournals with moderate or low h-index/g-index but strong niche focus (e.g., Information Technology & Tourism) indicate the specialized sub-areas within tourism scholarship. They may have fewer articles overall but still contribute valuable, specialized insights.\nInfluence of Journal Age:\nSome older journals (e.g., Annals of Tourism Research, started 1992) have large total citation counts thanks to decades-long scholarship. In contrast, newly launched or recently included journals may show lower overall metrics simply due to less citation-accumulation time.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe data reinforce the dominant local impact of long-established tourism journals, particularly Tourism Management, Annals of Tourism Research, and Journal of Travel Research. They feature the highest h-index and citation counts, underscoring their central role in advancing tourism scholarship. Meanwhile, newer or more specialized journals can still exhibit a strong m-index, reflecting rapid citation growth in emerging areas.\nIn summary, the local impact indicators (h-index, g-index, m-index, total citations) demonstrate a well-defined hierarchy of core tourism journals while highlighting the potential for newer outlets to build influence quickly through highly cited research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nh_index\ng_index\nm_index\nTC\nNP\nPY_start\n\n\n\n\nTOURISM MANAGEMENT\n54\n98\n2.3478261\n9706\n108\n2003\n\n\nANNALS OF TOURISM

the yearly publication counts from 1992 to 2025 for ten leading journals in tourism and hospitality:\n\nTourism Management\n\nJournal of Travel Research\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism\n\nCurrent Issues in Tourism\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research\n\nInternational Journal of Tourism Research\n\nJournal of Hospitality and Tourism Management\n\nTourism Management Perspectives\n\nAsia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research\n\nInternational Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management\n\n\nEarly Years (1992–2002)\n\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research dominates the early phase, appearing as early as 1992 with 1 publication, incrementally increasing to 4 publications by 2001.\n\nOther journals show zero publications during this period (e.g., Tourism Management, Journal of Travel Research).\n\n\nMid-Years (2003–2010)\n\n\nTourism Management starts contributing in 2003 with 1 publication, growing to 9 publications by 2010.\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research remains strong, going from 5 (2003) to 12 (2010).\n\nJournal of Travel Research emerges around 2009 with 2 publications, rising to 4 by 2010.\n\nInternational Journal of Tourism Research begins in 2008 with 1 article and reaches 4 by 2010.\n\n\nGrowth Phase (2011–2015)\n\n\nTourism Management and Annals of Tourism Research steadily increase. For example, Tourism Management rises from 9 (2011) to 22 (2015).\n\nJournal of Travel Research climbs from 9 (2011) to 20 (2015).\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism picks up pace, moving from 1 in 2010 to 14 in 2015.\n\nCurrent Issues in Tourism also starts to gain momentum, reaching 8 by 2015.\n\n\nAcceleration Period (2016–2020)\n\n\nTourism Management demonstrates a notable surge, growing from 33 (2016) to 70 (2020).\n\nJournal of Travel Research expands from 28 (2016) to 45 (2020).\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism grows quickly, from 18 (2016) to 43 (2020).\n\nTourism Management Perspectives (introduced in 2015) exhibits rapid early expansion, reaching 18 publications by 2020.\n\nInternational Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management increases from 3 (2016) to 22 (2020).\n\n\nRecent Years (2021–2025)\n\n\nContinued upward trend across all journals, with Tourism Management reaching 108 by 2025.\n\nJournal of Travel Research hits 97, Journal of Sustainable Tourism 96, and Current Issues in Tourism 90 by 2025.\n\nAnnals of Tourism Research stabilizes at 73 from 2024 to 2025, suggesting a plateau in this dataset.\n\nInternational Journal of Tourism Research hits 69, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management 55, and Tourism Management Perspectives 51 by 2025, all indicating robust yet slightly lower counts than the top three.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nDominance Shift Over Time\n\nWhile Annals of Tourism Research was the earliest mover, Tourism Management eventually overtakes it in volume. Similarly, Journal of Travel Research shows later but sustained growth, indicating a dynamic shift of publication leadership.\n\nRise of Sustainability and Specialized Focus\n\nJournal of Sustainable Tourism experiences a substantial lift after the mid-2000s. This may reflect the growing global emphasis on sustainable practices and research funding or academic interest in this subfield.\n\nEmergence of New Titles\n\nTourism Management Perspectives launched around 2015 and grows quickly, suggesting a demand for alternative outlets or specific focus areas within tourism management.\n\nAsia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research also gains traction steadily from the 2010s onward, highlighting the regional research expansion in tourism.\n\nOverall Increasing Trend\n\nNearly all titles show an upward trend in publication counts, which underscores the rapid expansion of tourism and hospitality research overall.\n\nThe convergence of counts by 2025 reveals multiple well-established journals in this domain rather than one or two dominating. This diversification indicates a maturing field with varied themes and focal areas.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nIn summary, the data reflect the evolution of tourism and hospitality scholarship over three decades. Early on, Annals of Tourism Research led the field; however, Tourism Management and Journal of Travel Research later rose to the forefront, indicating shifts in scholarly emphasis. The emergence and rapid rise of specialized journals (e.g., Journal of Sustainable Tourism, Tourism Management Perspectives) align with evolving research interests (sustainability, specialized management approaches). Ultimately, the growing publication counts suggest a highly active and continually diversifying research landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nTOURISM.MANAGEMENT\nJOURNAL.OF.TRAVEL.RESEARCH\nJOURNAL.OF.SUSTAINABLE.TOURISM\nCURRENT.ISSUES.IN.TOURISM\nANNALS.OF.TOURISM.RESEARCH\nINTERNATIONAL.JOURNAL.OF.TOURISM.RESEARCH\nJOURNAL.OF.HOSPITALITY.AND.TOURISM.MANAGEMENT\nTOURISM.MANAGEMENT.PERSPECTIVES\nASIA.PACIFIC.JOURNAL.OF.TOURISM.RESEARCH\nINTERNATIONAL.JOURNAL.OF.CONTEMPORARY.HOSPITALITY.MANAGEMENT\n\n\n\n\n1992\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1993\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1994\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1995\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1996\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1997\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1998\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1999\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2000\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2001\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2002\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2003\n1\n0\n0\n0\n5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2004\n1\n0\n0\n0\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2005\n1\n0\n0\n0\n7\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2006\n4\n0\n0\n0\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2007\n5\n0\n0\n0\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2008\n6\n0\n1\n0\n10\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2009\n8\n2\n1\n1\n11\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2010\n9\n4\n1\n2\n12\n4\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n2011\n9\n9\n1\n3\n13\n5\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n2012\n11\n12\n2\n6\n16\n5\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n2013\n13\n17\n6\n6\n19\n8\n0\n0\n2\n1\n\n\n2014\n19\n18\n8\n6\n23\n8\n0\n0\n4\n2\n\n\n2015\n22\n20\n14\n8\n26\n8\n0\n2\n7\n3\n\n\n2016\n33\n28\n18\n10\n28\n10\n1\n5\n11\n3\n\n\n2017\n47\n34\n25\n12\n32\n13\n2\n9\n17\n3\n\n\n2018\n56\n36\n29\n16\n34\n21\n3\n10\n21\n7\n\n\n2019\n61\n44\n34\n21\n39\n24\n11\n14\n24\n17\n\n\n2020\n70\n45\n43\n26\n54\n28\n18\n18\n31\n22\n\n\n2021\n78\n57\n52\n36\n58\n36\n26\n28\n34\n26\n\n\n2022\n88\n67\n63\n43\n64\n42\n27\n35\n37\n33\n\n\n2023\n93\n78\n83\n59\n68\n47\n41\n41\n42\n38\n\n\n2024\n99\n91\n96\n88\n73\n69\n54\n51\n49\n43\n\n\n2025\n108\n97\n96\n90\n73\n69\n55\n51\n49\n46"

    "text": "Authors\n\nAuthors\n\nMost Relevant Authors\n\nDescription\n\n\nHigh-Volume Authors\n\nThe list is headed by UYSAL M with 27 articles (fractional count: 8.75), followed by FILEP S (22 articles, 6.64 fractional) and KIM S (20 articles, 6.73 fractional).\n\nThese top contributors each have upwards of 15 total articles, indicating a select group who have published extensively in the field.\n\nFractionalized Authorship\n\nFractional counts (e.g., 8.75 for 27 articles, 6.64 for 22 articles) reflect shared authorship roles.\n\nLarge differences between total articles and fractional counts (e.g., 27 vs. 8.75 for UYSAL M) suggest collaborations with multiple co-authors.\n\nAuthors with similar total articles may show varying fractional counts, indicating differences in their level of contribution across each collaboration.\n\nLong Tail of Contributors\n\nAfter the top 10–15 names, there are many authors with fewer total articles (often under 10).\n\nThis highlights a broad, dispersed community of researchers contributing occasional or specialized studies.\n\nMultiple Authors Named “KIM,” “LEE,” “WANG,” “CHEN,” “ZHANG,” etc.\n\nCommon surnames among East Asian authors appear frequently, underscoring the global and particularly Asian involvement in tourism/hospitality research.\n\nCareful distinction is made via initials (e.g., KIM S, KIM H, KIM J) or fractional counts.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCore Group of Influential Scholars\n\nAuthors like UYSAL M, FILEP S, and KIM S have built substantial publication portfolios, indicating they may be leading voices or prolific senior researchers in tourism and hospitality scholarship.\n\nSignificance of Collaborative Research\n\nThe gap between total articles and fractional authorship suggests widespread co-authoring. Researchers are forming teams to tackle complex topics, share expertise, and leverage cross-institutional resources.\n\nGlobalization and Diversity\n\nThe presence of a vast array of names from varied linguistic backgrounds signals a global research network. Collaboration extends across continents, reflecting the international nature of tourism and hospitality studies.\n\nPotential Niche or Emergent Scholars\n\nThe numerous authors with 1 or 2 articles might be:\n\nEarly-career academics entering the field,\n\nPractitioners co-authoring in specialized areas, or\n\nOccasional contributors from adjacent disciplines (e.g., psychology, marketing, sustainability).\n\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nIn summary, a small group of highly prolific authors stands out, evidenced by both total and fractionalized article counts. The extensive collaborations indicated by fractional authorship counts reflect the team-based, interdisciplinary nature of tourism research. Meanwhile, the long tail of smaller contributors underscores the field’s broad appeal and global reach.\nOverall, the data reveal a dynamic scholarly community with a few leading figures and many emergent or specialized voices, collectively shaping the ongoing development of tourism and hospitality research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors\nArticles\nArticles.Fractionalized\n\n\n\n\nUYSAL M\n27\n8.750000\n\n\nFILEP S\n22\n6.642857\n\n\nKIM S\n20\n6.733333\n\n\nSU LJ\n18\n5.866667\n\n\nNAWIJN J\n15\n6.700000\n\n\nZHANG Y\n15\n5.616667\n\n\nKIM H\n14\n3.716667\n\n\nGAO J\n13\n4.116667\n\n\nLEE CK\n13\n4.066667\n\n\nLEE TJ\n13\n4.250000\n\n\nSTHAPIT E\n13\n4.366667\n\n\nWANG YC\n13\n3.950000\n\n\nCROES R\n12\n4.700000\n\n\nHAN H\n12\n3.166667\n\n\nSIRGY MJ\n12\n4.900000\n\n\nCHEN CC\n11\n3.816667\n\n\nPRAYAG G\n10\n3.500000\n\n\nRAMKISSOON H\n10\n3.650000\n\n\nVADA S\n10\n2.109524\n\n\nBERBEKOVA A\n9\n2.783333\n\n\nCHEN Y\n9\n3.000000\n\n\nFU XX\n9\n3.583333\n\n\nRASOOLIMANESH SM\n9\n3.000000\n\n\nRIDDERSTAAT J\n9\n3.000000\n\n\nWU MY\n9\n3.233333\n\n\nXIAO HG\n9\n3.250000\n\n\nKIM J\n8\n2.533333\n\n\nMITAS O\n8\n2.477778\n\n\nPETRICK JF\n8\n3.083333\n\n\nWOOSNAM KM\n8\n2.450000\n\n\nALRAWADIEH Z\n7\n2.116667\n\n\nBIMONTE S\n7\n3.750000\n\n\nGURSOY D\n7\n1.983333\n\n\nHUANG SS\n7\n2.700000\n\n\nJORDAN EJ\n7\n2.375000\n\n\nLAW R\n7\n1.733333\n\n\nLI J\n7\n2.000000\n\n\nLIANG ZX\n7\n2.833333\n\n\nMACKENZIE SH\n7\n2.533333\n\n\nMORGAN N\n7\n2.116667\n\n\nPINTO P\n7\n1.741667\n\n\nWONG IA\n7\n1.733333\n\n\nALTINAY L\n6\n1.666667\n\n\nBJÖRK P\n6\n2.250000\n\n\nBOLEY BB\n6\n1.676190\n\n\nEUSÉBIO C\n6\n1.550000\n\n\nFYALL A\n6\n1.533333\n\n\nJAAFAR M\n6\n1.833333\n\n\nLEE J\n6\n2.333333\n\n\nLEHTO XY\n6\n1.833333\n\n\nLIU Y\n6\n1.900000\n\n\nMODY M\n6\n1.866667\n\n\nMOYLE BD\n6\n1.316667\n\n\nPAGE SJ\n6\n2.666667\n\n\nPEARCE PL\n6\n2.750000\n\n\nQIAO GH\n6\n1.750000\n\n\nSUESS C\n6\n1.866667\n\n\nSWANSON SR\n6\n2.166667\n\n\nTSAUR SH\n6\n2.166667\n\n\nWEN J\n6\n1.283333\n\n\nYANG Y\n6\n1.833333\n\n\nZHENG DN\n6\n2.866667\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Local Cited Authors\nThe provided bibliometric analysis focuses on “most local citations” related to the field. “Local citations” typically refer to the number of times an author’s work is cited by other works within a specific dataset or field of study.\n\nDescription\n\n\nTop Local Citations\n\nUYSAL M leads with 1049 local citations, significantly ahead of all other authors.\n\nSIRGY MJ (830) and KIM H (654) also show notably high citation counts.\n\nOthers with 500+ citations include WOO E (536) and NAWIJN J (385).\n\nBroad Range of Citation Counts\n\nAfter the top tier (500+ citations), a long list of authors have citations ranging from a few hundred to single digits.\n\nThe dataset extends down to authors with 1 or 2 local citations, indicating a wide citation distribution across many contributors.\n\nEvidence of Numerous Contributors\n\nHundreds of authors appear, reflecting broad, collaborative research in the field.\n\nMany authors beyond the top 10–20 still maintain respectable citation counts (e.g., 50–200), underscoring a robust middle tier.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nInfluential Scholars\n\nHigh local citations (500+) often align with well-established researchers who have published extensively on seminal or in-demand topics (e.g., tourism impact, quality of life, hospitality management).\n\nUYSAL M and SIRGY MJ are prime examples of researchers whose foundational theories or frameworks likely generate ongoing citations.\n\nAcademic Focus and Collaboration\n\nThe number of authors listed indicates a wide-reaching, collaborative field.\n\nAuthors in the 100–300 citation range often engage in multiple co-authored projects across sub-disciplines (e.g., destination marketing, sustainable tourism). Their citation impact suggests relevance and consistent publication but perhaps with more specialized or emergent topics.\n\nLong Tail of New or Specialized Contributors\n\nMany authors with fewer citations could be early-career academics, occasional contributors, or scholars from related disciplines publishing in tourism/hospitality.\n\nThis “long tail” phenomenon is typical of a mature field, where a few authors lead in citations, but many still contribute in niche areas or collaborative projects.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nOverall, local citation counts reveal a core group of highly influential authors (e.g., Uysal, Sirgy, Kim) shaping major discussions in tourism and hospitality research. A substantial middle tier indicates a healthy ecosystem of established scholars, while the long tail underscores ongoing influx of new or specialized voices.\nIn summary, the breadth of authors and their varying citation levels signal a diverse and dynamic research community, with a few standout leaders consistently driving the field’s academic conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\nLocalCitations\n\n\n\n\nUYSAL M\n1049\n\n\nSIRGY MJ\n830\n\n\nKIM H\n654\n\n\nWOO E\n536\n\n\nNAWIJN J\n385\n\n\nMCCABE S\n260\n\n\nFILEP S\n249\n\n\nCHEN CC\n218\n\n\nCROES R\n210\n\n\nPETRICK JF\n201\n\n\nKIM K\n197\n\n\nANDERECK KL\n189\n\n\nNYAUPANE GP\n183\n\n\nSU LJ\n183\n\n\nCHEN Y\n179\n\n\nJOHNSON S\n171\n\n\nYU GB\n157\n\n\nLEE DJ\n154\n\n\nMITAS O\n153\n\n\nABDULLAH J\n146\n\n\nGILBERT D\n146\n\n\nDIEKMANN A\n138\n\n\nGURSOY D\n138\n\n\nSMITH MK\n138\n\n\nSHARPLEY R\n130\n\n\nKRUGER PS\n126\n\n\nRIDDERSTAAT J\n118\n\n\nDOLNICAR S\n116\n\n\nCLIFF K\n109\n\n\nYANAMANDRAM V\n109\n\n\nVADA S\n108\n\n\nLEHTO XY\n107\n\n\nLEE CK\n106\n\n\nRASOOLIMANESH SM\n104\n\n\nHARTWELL H\n103\n\n\nHEMINGWAY A\n103\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors’ Production over Time\nThis bibliometric analysis reflects the scholarly publications on the topic by various authors over the years. Let’s elaborate on the results, particularly focusing on the “authors’ production over time”:\n\nDescription\n\n\nCore Research Themes\n\nThe recurring focus is on well-being, quality of life (QOL), mental health, residents’ attitudes, and community development in tourism contexts.\n\nMany articles connect destination competitiveness, tourism experience, and sustainability to subjective well-being, underscoring how travelers’ and residents’ lives are impacted by tourism.\n\nTemporal and Topical Evolution\n\nEarlier Publications (2010–2013) emphasize foundational ideas:\n\nThe concept of holiday happiness curves\n\nMeasuring tourists’ changing emotions over trip durations\n\nLinks between leisure travel and life satisfaction\n\n\nMid-Period (2014–2017):\n\nA surge in co-creation and community-based tourism research\n\nGreater interest in nature-based or heritage tourism and their influences on well-being\n\nEmergence of casinos/gaming and festival events to study impacts on host communities’ QOL\n\nRecent Years (2018–2025):\n\nFocused on digital/virtual experiences, metaverse or VR tourism, and live streaming\n\nMental health and employee well-being in hospitality contexts\n\nDiaspora festivals, transnational religious tourism, and interdisciplinary approaches to QOL measurement\n\n\nHigh Citation vs. New Publications\n\nOlder, seminal articles (e.g., 2015–2016) often have very high total citations and a notable citations per year (TCpY).\n\nMany 2024–2025 publications show low or zero total citations due to their recent release, though some indicate promising themes (e.g., mental health, VR tourism) that align with emerging industry and societal trends.\n\nKey Authors and Contribution\n\nUYSAL M appears extensively, highlighting a strong research focus on quality of life, well-being metrics, and destination performance.\n\nFILEP S consistently explores tourist well-being from a positive psychology perspective, including hedonic/eudaimonic frameworks.\n\nKIM S, KIM H, SU LJ, and others analyze resident-tourist interactions, festival experiences, and community empowerment.\n\nRasoolimanesh SM, Ramkissoon H, Prayag G, Croes R, etc., focus on sustainable tourism and destination management through quality-of-life lenses.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nGrowing Importance of Well-Being Paradigms\n\nThe repeated emphasis on quality of life and subjective well-being indicates a paradigm shift: tourism success is no longer measured solely by economic gains, but also by social, psychological, and environmental dimensions.\n\nInterdisciplinary and Global Collaboration\n\nMany articles integrate frameworks from psychology (e.g., PERMA model), sociology (solidarity, empowerment), and business/marketing (value co-creation), showcasing cross-disciplinary research designs.\n\nTopics like virtual reality or metaverse tourism reveal expansions into technological and digital aspects of tourism experiences.\n\nAttention to Diverse Stakeholders\n\nAuthors increasingly examine residents’ attitudes, empowerment, and social responsibility—indicating that the host community perspective is central to sustainable tourism.\n\nThere is also attention to employees’ mental health and hospitality workplace well-being, reflecting a holistic industry approach.\n\nContinued Innovation\n\nMost recent publications (2023–2025) delve into new theories (e.g., diaspora and spiritual festivals, pet-accompanying tourism, K-pop music tourism, AI usage) to clarify how tourism fosters or hampers well-being across contexts.\n\nThese directions suggest an ongoing evolution of tourism scholarship toward more nuanced, human-centric frameworks.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nOverall, the dataset underscores a dynamic and continually diversifying field of tourism research, with well-being and quality of life emerging as central metrics of both traveler and resident outcomes. The broad range of authors, years, and interdisciplinary theories reveal how tourism and hospitality scholarship is expanding to include technological, social, and psychological determinants of success.\nIn summary, the collective publications illustrate a mature research landscape increasingly focused on sustainability, mental health, and community well-being—a vital shift from purely economic perspectives to holistic measures of tourism’s impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\nyear\nTI\nSO\nDOI\nTC\nTCpY\n\n\n\n\nUYSAL M\n2025\nINTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO TOURISM DEMAND MODELING: QUALITY OF LIFE INDICATORS\nJOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY & TOURISM RESEARCH\n10.1177/10963480241229238\n0\n0.0000000\n\n\nUYSAL M\n2025\nQUALITY-OF-LIFE: A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF RESEARCH PROGRESS\nTOURISM MANAGEMENT\n10.1016/j.tourman.2024.105070\n2\n2.0000000\n\n\nUYSAL M\n2025\nQUALITY OF LIFE PERFORMANCE INDEX FOR TOURISM DESTINATIONS☆\nTOURISM MANAGEMENT\n10.1016/j.tourman.2024.105091\n0\n0.0000000\n\n\nUYSAL M\n2024\nTOURISM DEVELOPMENT AS A MODERATOR BETWEEN EMOTION AND WELL-BEING\nTOURISM RECREATION RESEARCH\n10.1080/02508281.2023.2216524\n0\n0.0000000\n\n\nUYSAL M\n2024\nQUALITY OF LIFE AND PUBLIC POLICY DEVELOPMENT FOR TOURISM DESTINATIONS\nCORNELL HOSPITALITY QUARTERLY\n10.1177/19389655231182089\n8\n4.0000000\n\n\nUYSAL M\n2024\nSMART TOURISM DESTINATION (STD): DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING AN IMPACT SCALE USING RESIDENTS' OVERALL LIFE SATISFACTION\nCURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM\n10.1080/13683500.2023.2296587\n2\n1.0000000\n\n\nUYSAL M\n2022\nTOWARD AN ASSESSMENT OF QUALITY OF LIFE INDICATORS AS MEASURES OF DESTINATION PERFORMANCE\nJOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH\n10.1177/00472875211026755\n27\n6.7500000\n\n\nUYSAL M\n2022\nPURSUING JUSTICE AND QUALITY OF LIFE: SUPPORTING TOURISM\nTOURISM MANAGEMENT\n10.1016/j.tourman.2021.104446\n33\n8.2500000\n\n\nUYSAL M\n2022\nGLADIIS ET CLYPEIS: TRAVEL MOTIVES TOWARDS AN IMPROVEMENT OF QUALITY OF LIFE WHEN VISITING A MILITARY EXPO\nTOURISM ANALYSIS\n10.3727/108354221X16187814403065\n1\n0.2500000\n\n\nUYSAL M\n2022\nGASTRO-TOURISM WELL-BEING: THE INTERPLAYS OF SALIENT AND ENDURING DETERMINANTS\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT\n10.1108/IJCHM-09-2021-1132\n15\n3.7500000\n\n\nUYSAL M\n2021\nIS THIS ABOUT FEELING?

Named after Alfred J. Lotka, who proposed the idea in 1926, this law describes the frequency with which authors publish in a particular field.\nLotka’s Law can be represented mathematically as:\n\\[ Y = \\frac{C} {X^{\\alpha}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n$ Y $ is the number of authors making $ X $ contributions\n$ C $ is a constant (it describes the number of authors making only one contribution)\n$ $ is a constant usually close to 2 (though it can vary depending on the discipline).\n\nInterpretation of Lotka’s Law:\n\nMajority Publishes Once: A large number of authors will have only one publication, which corresponds to the value of $ C $.\nDecrease in Frequency: As the number of publications per author (i.e., productivity) increases, the number of authors who have published that many times decreases, and this decrease is very sharp (often described as an inverse square law).\nFew Prolific Authors: Only a very small number of authors will be responsible for a large portion of the publications in a particular field. This can be thought of as the “80-20” principle, where a minority (often around 20%) of authors produce the majority (around 80%) of the work.\n\nApplication:\n\nIdentify Core Authors: By applying Lotka’s Law, organizations and researchers can identify the core authors or the most prolific contributors in a particular field or topic.\nAnalysis of Scientific Output: Lotka’s Law can be utilized to analyze the scientific output of a field, helping in recognizing the distribution of productivity among authors.\nResearch Evaluation: Research institutions might use this principle to evaluate the research output of their faculty or departments, understanding the distribution of prolific authors versus those who publish less frequently.\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that while Lotka’s Law provides a useful general observation about scientific productivity, there are variations depending on the specific scientific discipline or field of study. The values of $ C $ and $ alpha $ might differ across disciplines, and in some cases, other bibliometric models might offer a better fit to the data.\n\nMeasurement for the Lotka’s law is the following:\n\nN.Articles: This is the number of articles written by an author.\nN.Authors: This is the number of authors who have written the corresponding N.Articles.\nFreq: This is the frequency (proportion) of those authors relative to the total number of authors.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe table shows how many authors have published N articles, alongside the frequency of authors for each N.\n\nHighest Frequency at N=1:\n\n2613 authors (80.20%) have just 1 article, the largest group, indicating a “long tail” of contributors.\n\nThis high proportion of single-publication authors is typical in many scholarly fields, aligning with the inverse-square or inverse-power distribution suggested by Lotka’s Law.\n\nGradual Decrease for Higher N:\n\nAs the number of articles authored (N) increases, the number of authors contributing that many articles decreases sharply. For instance:\n\n2 articles: 377 authors (11.57%)\n\n3 articles: 106 authors (3.25%)\n\n5 articles: 31 authors (0.95%)\n\nVery few authors produce more than 10 articles.\n\n\nVery Productive Authors:\n\nOnly 1 author has produced 27 articles, one has 22, and one has 20, illustrating the pattern in which a tiny minority of authors contributes a large volume of publications.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nClassic Power-Law Behavior:\nThe table demonstrates a steep power-law (or Lotka-like) distribution, where most authors publish just once, while a small subset of highly productive authors accounts for many publications.\nField Maturity and Broad Inclusion:\nThe large proportion of single-publication authors signals:\n\nField Openness: Many researchers (possibly from adjacent disciplines) publish occasionally in this domain.\n\nPotential Collaboration: Some of these single-publication authors may be graduate students or co-authors with senior researchers, indicating a collaborative environment.\n\nIdentification of Core Authors:\nA handful of authors consistently publishing 10+ articles are likely key influencers or thought leaders in the research area. Their high productivity positions them at the center of scholarly discourse.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe data conform well to Lotka’s Law, illustrating a typical author productivity pattern: 1. Most authors publish one article only.\n2. A much smaller group demonstrates moderate productivity (2–5 articles).\n3. An extremely small cohort of authors achieve high productivity (10+ articles).\nIn summary, these findings highlight a highly skewed productivity distribution common in scientific fields, where a majority of authors contribute a single study, and a small group drives a significant fraction of the total output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN.Articles\nN.Authors\nFreq\n\n\n\n\n1\n2613\n0.8020257827\n\n\n2\n377\n0.1157151627\n\n\n3\n106\n0.0325352977\n\n\n4\n69\n0.0211786372\n\n\n5\n31\n0.0095150399\n\n\n6\n20\n0.0061387354\n\n\n7\n12\n0.0036832413\n\n\n8\n4\n0.0012277471\n\n\n9\n7\n0.0021485574\n\n\n10\n3\n0.0009208103\n\n\n11\n1\n0.0003069368\n\n\n12\n3\n0.0009208103\n\n\n13\n5\n0.0015346839\n\n\n14\n1\n0.0003069368\n\n\n15\n2\n0.0006138735\n\n\n18\n1\n0.0003069368\n\n\n20\n1\n0.0003069368\n\n\n22\n1\n0.0003069368\n\n\n27\n1\n0.0003069368\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthors’ Local Impact\n\nThe followings are the measurement of the local impact\n\nElement: Name of the author.\nh_index: h-index of the author, which represents the maximum number of articles an author has written that have received at least the same number of citations.\ng_index: g-index of the author, a metric that takes into account the distribution of citations received by a researcher’s publications.\nm_index: Rate of acquiring h-index points. It is calculated by dividing the h-index by the number of years since the first published paper of the author.\nTC: Total citations the author has received.\nNP: Number of publications by the author.\nPY_start: The year of the author’s first publication.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nHigh-Impact Leaders:\n\nUYSAL M stands out with an h-index of 16 and g-index of 27 from 27 publications (TC = 3007) since his first publication in 2013. His m-index of 1.23 indicates robust citation accumulation per year.\nNAWIJN J (h = 14, g = 15, NP = 15, TC = 1219, PY_start = 2010) and FILEP S (h = 13, g = 22, NP = 22, TC = 582, PY_start = 2012) follow as influential authors in the dataset.\n\nDiverse Productivity and Citation Profiles:\n\nSome authors, like SU LJ (h = 13, m = 1.18) and KIM H (h = 10, m = 0.91), show a solid balance between publication output and impact.\n\nIn contrast, LEE CK (h = 11, m = 0.48) has a longer career starting in 2003 with 13 articles, but a lower m-index indicates slower yearly citation accumulation.\n\nVaried Career Stages:\n\nThe starting years (PY_start) range from as early as 2003 (e.g., LEE CK) to more recent years such as 2020–2021 (e.g., ALRAWADIEH Z, WEN J), reflecting both long-established and emerging voices.\nThe m-index (TC/NP normalized by career length) helps compare authors across different career spans, revealing that more recent authors can achieve high annual impact even with fewer publications.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCitation Impact vs. Publication Volume:\n\nA high h-index and g-index generally point to a consistent influence of an author’s work. For instance, UYSAL M’s metrics (16/27) reflect that many of his 27 articles are highly cited.\n\nAuthors like NAWIJN J, with 15 publications and an h-index of 14, demonstrate that nearly every publication has contributed to his citation profile.\n\nNormalized Productivity (m-index):\n\nThe m-index gives insight into the annual impact. UYSAL M’s m-index of 1.23 is particularly strong considering he started in 2013, meaning he has averaged a good citation rate each year.\n\nLower m-index values (e.g., LEE CK’s 0.48) can be attributed to a longer career span where earlier publications may have had less impact or a slower rate of citation growth.\n\nField Evolution and Emerging Scholars:\n\nAuthors with later start years (e.g., ALRAWADIEH Z, MITAS O) and relatively high m-index values suggest that newer contributions are quickly gaining recognition.\n\nThe range of indices across authors reflects the interdisciplinary and evolving nature of the field, where both established researchers and newer entrants contribute to its growth.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe local impact metrics reveal a hierarchy of influence: - Core leaders like UYSAL M, NAWIJN J, FILEP S, and SU LJ have achieved high citation impact relative to their output, indicating that their work is both prolific and influential. - Normalized indices (m-index) help account for differences in career duration, showing that newer authors can be very impactful on an annual basis. - Variations in metrics among authors with similar publication counts (NP) underline differences in citation performance and influence.\nIn summary, the data show a skewed distribution where a relatively small group of authors achieves high impact (reflected by high h- and g-indices and m-index values), while others have moderate performance. This pattern is typical in many academic fields, indicating that a few key researchers drive the bulk of the influential scholarship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\nh_index\ng_index\nm_index\nTC\nNP\nPY_start\n\n\n\n\nUYSAL M\n16\n27\n1.2307692\n3007\n27\n2013\n\n\nNAWIJN J\n14\n15\n0.8750000\n1219\n15\n2010\n\n\nFILEP S\n13\n22\n0.9285714\n582\n22\n2012\n\n\nSU LJ\n13\n18\n1.1818182\n713\n18\n2015\n\n\nLEE CK\n11\n13\n0.4782609\n609\n13\n2003\n\n\nHAN H\n10\n12\n1.4285714\n528\n12\n2019\n\n\nKIM H\n10\n14\n0.9090909\n1955\n14\n2015\n\n\nKIM S\n10\n17\n0.7692308\n322\n20\n2013\n\n\nLEE TJ\n10\n13\n1.0000000\n390\n13\n2016\n\n\nSIRGY MJ\n10\n12\n0.6250000\n2024\n12\n2010\n\n\nCHEN CC\n9\n11\n0.6923077\n769\n11\n2013\n\n\nCROES R\n9\n12\n0.6428571\n661\n12\n2012\n\n\nPRAYAG G\n9\n10\n0.8181818\n457\n10\n2015\n\n\nCHEN Y\n8\n9\n0.5714286\n656\n9\n2012\n\n\nRAMKISSOON H\n8\n10\n1.0000000\n524\n10\n2018\n\n\nWANG YC\n8\n13\n1.3333333\n237\n13\n2020\n\n\nALRAWADIEH Z\n7\n7\n1.4000000\n127\n7\n2021\n\n\nFU XX\n7\n9\n0.5833333\n223\n9\n2014\n\n\nGAO J\n7\n13\n0.8750000\n237\n13\n2018\n\n\nHUANG SS\n7\n7\n0.6363636\n320\n7\n2015\n\n\nLAW R\n7\n7\n0.7000000\n258\n7\n2016\n\n\nLI J\n7\n7\n1.0000000\n179\n7\n2019\n\n\nMITAS O\n7\n8\n0.5000000\n694\n8\n2012\n\n\nRIDDERSTAAT J\n7\n9\n0.7000000\n347\n9\n2016\n\n\nSTHAPIT E\n7\n13\n0.8750000\n397\n13\n2018\n\n\nBIMONTE S\n6\n7\n0.4285714\n217\n7\n2012\n\n\nGURSOY D\n6\n7\n0.3529412\n527\n7\n2009\n\n\nJAAFAR M\n6\n6\n0.5454545\n805\n6\n2015\n\n\nJORDAN EJ\n6\n7\n0.5454545\n281\n7\n2015\n\n\nKIM J\n6\n8\n0.5454545\n347\n8\n2015\n\n\nMODY M\n6\n6\n0.6666667\n285\n6\n2017\n\n\nPEARCE PL\n6\n6\n0.4285714\n346\n6\n2012\n\n\nPETRICK JF\n6\n8\n0.4615385\n770\n8\n2013\n\n\nQIAO GH\n6\n6\n0.8571429\n85\n6\n2019\n\n\nRASOOLIMANESH SM\n6\n9\n0.5454545\n970\n9\n2015\n\n\nSUESS C\n6\n6\n0.6666667\n295\n6\n2017\n\n\nVADA S\n6\n10\n1.0000000\n219\n10\n2020\n\n\nWU MY\n6\n9\n0.5000000\n112\n9\n2014\n\n\nZHANG Y\n6\n9\n0.8571429\n91\n15\n2019\n\n\nALTINAY L\n5\n6\n1.0000000\n93\n6\n2021\n\n\nBERBEKOVA A\n5\n9\n0.8333333\n160\n9\n2020\n\n\nDOGRU T\n5\n5\n0.7142857\n214\n5\n2019\n\n\nFYALL A\n5\n6\n0.5555556\n270\n6\n2017\n\n\nKING B\n5\n5\n0.5000000\n147\n5\n2016\n\n\nLEHTO XY\n5\n6\n0.2941176\n428\n6\n2009\n\n\nLIANG ZX\n5\n7\n0.5000000\n185\n7\n2016\n\n\nMACKENZIE SH\n5\n7\n0.8333333\n146\n7\n2020\n\n\nMCCABE S\n5\n5\n0.3125000\n615\n5\n2010\n\n\nSWANSON SR\n5\n6\n0.8333333\n241\n6\n2020\n\n\nWEN J\n5\n6\n1.2500000\n135\n6\n2022\n\n\nWOO E\n5\n5\n0.4545455\n1316\n5\n2015\n\n\nWOOSNAM KM\n5\n8\n0.5555556\n336\n8\n2017\n\n\nXIAO HG\n5\n9\n0.7142857\n202\n9\n2019\n\n\nYANG Y\n5\n6\n0.4166667\n135\n6\n2014\n\n\nZHENG DN\n5\n6\n0.8333333\n590\n6\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliations\n\nMost Relevant Affiliations\nThe data provided is a bibliometric analysis focusing on the affiliations that have contributed to research related to psychological entitlement. Bibliometric analyses help understand the research landscape of a specific topic by evaluating the academic output from various institutions. The data lists different university systems and universities with the number of articles they’ve published on the topic.\n\nDescription\n\n\nTop Affiliations by Article Count:\n\nSTATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF FLORIDA leads with 104 articles.\nHONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY follows closely with 97 articles.\nGRIFFITH UNIVERSITY contributes 73 articles, while SUN YAT SEN UNIVERSITY and UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA add 56 and 55 articles, respectively.\n\nDiverse Global Representation:\n\nThe list features institutions from North America (e.g., University of Central Florida, Texas A&M University System, Purdue University System), Asia (e.g., Sun Yat Sen University, Kyung Hee University, Zhejiang University), Australia (e.g., Griffith University, University of Queensland), and Europe (e.g., University of Surrey, Bournemouth University).\nSome systems and multi-campus networks (e.g., Texas A&M University System, California State University System) indicate that research in tourism is often supported by large academic networks.\n\nSpecialized and Regional Institutions:\n\nA number of affiliations are focused on regional and applied research (e.g., Breda University of Applied Sciences, Macau University of Science and Technology), suggesting a strong applied orientation in tourism scholarship.\nThere are also specialized institutions that appear to concentrate on tourism/hospitality studies, such as City University of Macau and Taylor’s University.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nGeographic Diversity and Focus:\n\nThe high-ranking affiliations come from regions with dynamic tourism sectors, suggesting that local industry relevance and regional economic importance drive research output.\nInstitutions from Florida, Hong Kong, and Australia dominate, reflecting their strong tourism industries and established research infrastructures.\n\nInstitutional Networks and Research Clusters:\n\nUniversity systems (e.g., State University System of Florida, Texas A&M University System, California State University System) contribute significantly, demonstrating the role of institutional networks in fostering collaborative and high-volume research.\nThe presence of both comprehensive universities and specialized institutions points to a balance between theoretical and applied research in tourism and hospitality.\n\nImpact on Policy and Practice:\n\nLeading institutions often inform both academic debates and practical policy decisions in tourism. Their high article counts suggest they are key players in shaping sustainable tourism practices and industry standards.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nOverall, the distribution of articles across affiliations shows a broad and globally diverse network of institutions contributing to tourism research. A few key players—especially from regions with strong tourism industries—dominate the field, while a wide range of universities, from large state systems to specialized and regional institutions, enrich the research landscape with varied perspectives and applied insights.\nIn summary, the data underscore that major research outputs in tourism are concentrated in a handful of influential affiliations, reflecting regional economic importance, robust institutional networks, and a balance between theoretical and practical contributions in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliation\nArticles\n\n\n\n\nSTATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF FLORIDA\n104\n\n\nHONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY\n97\n\n\nGRIFFITH UNIVERSITY\n73\n\n\nSUN YAT SEN UNIVERSITY\n56\n\n\nUNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA\n55\n\n\nKYUNG HEE UNIVERSITY\n40\n\n\nUNIVERSIDADE DO ALGARVE\n40\n\n\nUNIVERSITY OF JOHANNESBURG\n40\n\n\nPENNSYLVANIA COMMONWEALTH SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION (PCSHE)\n38\n\n\nUNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND\n38\n\n\nUNIVERSITY OF SURREY\n36\n\n\nGRIFFITH UNIVERSITY - GOLD COAST CAMPUS\n34\n\n\nVIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND STATE UNIVERSITY\n32\n\n\nTEXAS AANDM UNIVERSITY SYSTEM\n29\n\n\nCALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM\n28\n\n\nTEXAS AANDM UNIVERSITY COLLEGE STATION\n28\n\n\nBREDA UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES\n27\n\n\nPURDUE UNIVERSITY\n27\n\n\nPURDUE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM\n27\n\n\nUNIVERSITY OF OTAGO\n27\n\n\nSEJONG UNIVERSITY\n26\n\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS SYSTEM\n25\n\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST\n24\n\n\nBOURNEMOUTH UNIVERSITY\n23\n\n\nMACAU UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\n23\n\n\nTAYLOR'S UNIVERSITY\n23\n\n\nZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY\n23\n\n\nARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY\n22\n\n\nCITY UNIVERSITY OF MACAU\n22\n\n\nUNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF GEORGIA\n21\n\n\nPENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY\n20\n\n\nUNIVERSIDADE DE AVEIRO\n20\n\n\nWASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliations’ Production over time\nThe table provided represents a bibliometric analysis of the production of articles related across different universities and university systems over a span of approximately two decades. Here’s an elaboration and interpretation of the results for each institution:\n\nDescription\n\nThe table displays the yearly article output for several key affiliations in tourism research. Notable patterns include:\n\nDelayed Start & Gradual Onset:\n\nMany institutions (e.g., Kyung Hee University, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, University of Queensland, and State University System of Florida) show no production in the early 1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nProduction begins modestly (often 1–2 articles per year) in the mid-2000s.\n\nSteady Increase with Recent Acceleration:\n\nOver time, article counts gradually increase. For example, Kyung Hee University increases from 2–5 articles in the 2003–2013 period, reaching 13–14 articles by 2019–2021, and then leaping to 39–40 articles in 2024–2025.\n\nHong Kong Polytechnic University similarly grows slowly until around 2014–2015, then accelerates dramatically: from 10 articles in 2016 to 90–97 articles by 2024–2025.\n\nOther affiliations, such as the State University System of Florida and University of Central Florida, show a similar pattern—little or no output in the early years and then a rapid ramp-up in the 2010s, peaking in the early 2020s.\n\nVariation Among Institutions:\n\nWhile some institutions like University of Queensland and Sun Yat Sen University also show an upward trend, the magnitude and pace vary.\n\nFor instance, Universidade do Algarve had negligible output until 2017 and then a marked increase in recent years (from 1 article per year up to 39–40 articles by 2024–2025).\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nField Maturation and Increased Emphasis:\nThe nearly universal absence of articles before the mid-2000s suggests that tourism research, at least as indexed in this dataset, was either in its infancy or not a priority at many institutions. The subsequent growth reflects:\n\nA maturation of the field as tourism became an increasingly important economic, social, and environmental subject.\nEnhanced institutional support and funding for tourism/hospitality research over time.\n\nExponential Growth in Recent Years:\nThe accelerated output from around 2018 onward for many affiliations (e.g., Hong Kong Polytechnic University, State University System of Florida) likely indicates:\n\nA surge in research interest driven by global trends such as sustainability, digital transformation (e.g., virtual tourism), and the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on travel.\nGreater collaboration and interdisciplinary approaches that boost publication output.\n\nRegional Differences:\nInstitutions in regions with vibrant tourism industries (e.g., Florida, Hong Kong, Australia) exhibit particularly high growth rates. In contrast, some institutions with later entry into the field (e.g., Universidade do Algarve) show a delayed but rapid ramp-up, perhaps as the region’s tourism issues gained prominence.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe data reveal that the production of tourism research has experienced a significant, mostly exponential increase over the past two decades. While many key affiliations showed little or no output in the early years, all have ramped up their production substantially, with especially dramatic increases observed from around 2018 onward.\nIn summary, these trends underscore the growing academic and practical importance of tourism research worldwide. The consistent rise in article output across diverse institutions reflects both a maturing field and the increasing global relevance of tourism, sustainability, and hospitality studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliation\nYear\nArticles\n\n\n\n\nKYUNG HEE UNIVERSITY\n1992\n0\n\n\nKYUNG HEE UNIVERSITY\n1995\n0\n\n\nKYUNG HEE UNIVERSITY\n1996\n0\n\n\nKYUNG HEE

entitlement based on the country of the corresponding author. Here’s an interpretation and elaboration of the results:\n\nDescription\n\n\nTop Producers by Article Count:\n\nChina leads with 304 articles (≈19.58% of total), followed by the USA with 261 articles (≈16.81%), and then the United Kingdom (116 articles, ≈7.47%) and Australia (107 articles, ≈6.89%).\n\nOther notable contributors include Korea (80 articles), Spain (73), Portugal (53), India (48), Italy (36), and Canada (33).\n\nCollaboration Patterns (SCP vs. MCP):\n\nSingle Country Publications (SCP) vs. Multiple Country Publications (MCP) provide insight into collaboration intensity. For example, China has 174 SCP and 130 MCP, meaning about 42.76% of its output is international collaboration.\n\nThe USA shows a lower international share at 33.72% (173 SCP vs. 88 MCP).\n\nIn contrast, countries such as Korea (68.75% MCP) and Malaysia (68% MCP) have a high proportion of multi-country collaborations.\nSome European countries (e.g., UK at 41.38%, Australia at 49.53%) show a balance between domestic and international outputs, whereas others (e.g., Spain at 26.03%, India at 14.58%) lean more toward domestic research.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nVolume and Influence:\n\nThe top-producing countries (China, USA, UK, Australia) dominate overall production. Their high output may be driven by strong national research systems, significant tourism industries, and a high level of academic investment in tourism and hospitality studies.\n\nInternational Collaboration Trends:\n\nHigher MCP percentages in countries like Korea and Malaysia suggest that researchers there are highly engaged in cross-border collaborations. This can enrich research by bringing diverse perspectives and may reflect the strategic importance of global networks in rapidly evolving tourism contexts.\nLower MCP percentages for countries like India and Spain indicate that a larger share of their research is produced domestically. This might reflect either a strong local research community or less integration into international collaborative networks.\n\nRegional Dynamics:\n\nMany of the top-producing countries are from regions with vibrant tourism industries and strong governmental or institutional support for tourism research. The collaboration patterns can also hint at differences in research culture—some regions may prioritize international partnership while others focus on addressing local issues.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThese country-level data reveal that a few countries (China and the USA, in particular) produce a significant share of tourism research, while international collaboration levels vary considerably. Higher international collaboration percentages in countries like Korea and Malaysia suggest that global networks play a critical role in advancing their research, whereas other nations tend to produce more domestic work.\nIn summary, the data underscore both the concentration of research output in a few major countries and the diverse collaboration strategies that reflect regional priorities and research cultures in the field of tourism and hospitality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nArticles\nArticles.%\nSCP\nMCP\nMCP.%\n\n\n\n\nCHINA\n304\n19.5750161\n174\n130\n42.76316\n\n\nUSA\n261\n16.8061816\n173\n88\n33.71648\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\n116\n7.4694140\n68\n48\n41.37931\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\n107\n6.8898905\n54\n53\n49.53271\n\n\nKOREA\n80\n5.1513200\n25\n55\n68.75000\n\n\nSPAIN\n73\n4.7005795\n54\n19\n26.02740\n\n\nPORTUGAL\n53\n3.4127495\n41\n12\n22.64151\n\n\nINDIA\n48\n3.0907920\n41\n7\n14.58333\n\n\nITALY\n36\n2.3180940\n27\n9\n25.00000\n\n\nCANADA\n33\n2.1249195\n19\n14\n42.42424\n\n\nNEW ZEALAND\n32\n2.0605280\n18\n14\n43.75000\n\n\nTURKEY\n29\n1.8673535\n18\n11\n37.93103\n\n\nMALAYSIA\n25\n1.6097875\n8\n17\n68.00000\n\n\nNETHERLANDS\n23\n1.4810045\n14\n9\n39.13043\n\n\nBRAZIL\n19\n1.2234385\n16\n3\n15.78947\n\n\nAUSTRIA\n18\n1.1590470\n9\n9\n50.00000\n\n\nFINLAND\n18\n1.1590470\n9\n9\n50.00000\n\n\nJAPAN\n17\n1.0946555\n10\n7\n41.17647\n\n\nTHAILAND\n15\n0.9658725\n8\n7\n46.66667\n\n\nNORWAY\n12\n0.7726980\n6\n6\n50.00000\n\n\nSOUTH AFRICA\n12\n0.7726980\n7\n5\n41.66667\n\n\nSWITZERLAND\n12\n0.7726980\n8\n4\n33.33333\n\n\nIRAN\n10\n0.6439150\n4\n6\n60.00000\n\n\nINDONESIA\n9\n0.5795235\n6\n3\n33.33333\n\n\nPOLAND\n9\n0.5795235\n6\n3\n33.33333\n\n\nFRANCE\n8\n0.5151320\n5\n3\n37.50000\n\n\nGERMANY\n8\n0.5151320\n2\n6\n75.00000\n\n\nMEXICO\n8\n0.5151320\n4\n4\n50.00000\n\n\nCROATIA\n7\n0.4507405\n5\n2\n28.57143\n\n\nVIETNAM\n7\n0.4507405\n3\n4\n57.14286\n\n\nCYPRUS\n6\n0.3863490\n4\n2\n33.33333\n\n\nSERBIA\n6\n0.3863490\n1\n5\n83.33333\n\n\nHUNGARY\n5\n0.3219575\n2\n3\n60.00000\n\n\nPAKISTAN\n5\n0.3219575\n2\n3\n60.00000\n\n\nSWEDEN\n5\n0.3219575\n5\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nGHANA\n4\n0.2575660\n2\n2\n50.00000\n\n\nISRAEL\n4\n0.2575660\n2\n2\n50.00000\n\n\nOMAN\n4\n0.2575660\n0\n4\n100.00000\n\n\nRUSSIA\n4\n0.2575660\n4\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nSLOVENIA\n4\n0.2575660\n4\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nBANGLADESH\n3\n0.1931745\n1\n2\n66.66667\n\n\nCZECH REPUBLIC\n3\n0.1931745\n3\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nIRELAND\n3\n0.1931745\n3\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nJORDAN\n3\n0.1931745\n2\n1\n33.33333\n\n\nSINGAPORE\n3\n0.1931745\n1\n2\n66.66667\n\n\nU ARAB EMIRATES\n3\n0.1931745\n2\n1\n33.33333\n\n\nBULGARIA\n2\n0.1287830\n2\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nCOLOMBIA\n2\n0.1287830\n2\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nDENMARK\n2\n0.1287830\n1\n1\n50.00000\n\n\nESTONIA\n2\n0.1287830\n1\n1\n50.00000\n\n\nFIJI\n2\n0.1287830\n1\n1\n50.00000\n\n\nGREECE\n2\n0.1287830\n1\n1\n50.00000\n\n\nICELAND\n2\n0.1287830\n2\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nMAURITIUS\n2\n0.1287830\n0\n2\n100.00000\n\n\nNEPAL\n2\n0.1287830\n2\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nNIGERIA\n2\n0.1287830\n0\n2\n100.00000\n\n\nPANAMA\n2\n0.1287830\n0\n2\n100.00000\n\n\nPERU\n2\n0.1287830\n0\n2\n100.00000\n\n\nPHILIPPINES\n2\n0.1287830\n2\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nSAUDI ARABIA\n2\n0.1287830\n0\n2\n100.00000\n\n\nSRI LANKA\n2\n0.1287830\n1\n1\n50.00000\n\n\nARGENTINA\n1\n0.0643915\n1\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nBELGIUM\n1\n0.0643915\n1\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nBHUTAN\n1\n0.0643915\n1\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nBOTSWANA\n1\n0.0643915\n1\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nBRUNEI\n1\n0.0643915\n1\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nCHILE\n1\n0.0643915\n0\n1\n100.00000\n\n\nECUADOR\n1\n0.0643915\n1\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nEGYPT\n1\n0.0643915\n0\n1\n100.00000\n\n\nJAMAICA\n1\n0.0643915\n0\n1\n100.00000\n\n\nMACEDONIA\n1\n0.0643915\n0\n1\n100.00000\n\n\nROMANIA\n1\n0.0643915\n1\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nTANZANIA\n1\n0.0643915\n1\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nTUNISIA\n1\n0.0643915\n1\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nUKRAINE\n1\n0.0643915\n1\n0\n0.00000\n\n\nURUGUAY\n1\n0.0643915\n0\n1\n100.00000\n\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n1\n0.0643915\n0\n1\n100.00000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountries’ Scientific Production\n\nDescription\n\n\nTop Producers by Region:\n\nChina leads with 774 publications, followed by the USA (679) and Australia (287).\n\nOther significant contributors include the UK (282), Spain (172), Portugal (171), and South Korea (170). These regions represent a major portion of global tourism research output.\n\nModerate Contribution from Other Regions:\n\nCountries such as India (105), New Zealand (82), Malaysia (81), and Canada (70) contribute notably fewer publications but still hold importance in the global tourism research landscape.\n\nSmaller Regional Contributions:\n\nSeveral countries in Europe and Asia have lesser contributions with countries like Finland, Japan, and Austria having around 30–40 publications, showing less intense involvement in tourism research compared to the top countries.\n\nEmerging or Niche Contributors:\n\nSmaller countries like Vietnam (20), Poland (19), Ghana (18), Switzerland (18), Mexico (17), and Russia (17) have a more specialized presence in tourism research.\nEmerging economies such as Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, and Uruguay (2–3 publications) show nascent involvement, possibly linked to the growing interest in tourism within these regions.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nDominance of Major Tourism Markets:\n\nThe most prolific regions—China, USA, Australia, UK—reflect the global tourism leaders in terms of both research output and tourism industry influence. These regions invest significantly in tourism studies due to their established academic and tourism infrastructures.\n\nIncreasing Participation from Asia and Europe:\n\nSouth Korea and Malaysia show a strong growth trend, with South Korea reaching 170 publications. This signals an expanding interest in tourism research in the Asian market, particularly in areas related to culture, sustainability, and technology in tourism.\nPortugal, Spain, and Italy reflect strong regional engagement with tourism, likely tied to the importance of tourism to their respective economies and cultures.\n\nGlobal Disparities in Research Contribution:\n\nRegions like Africa, South America, and parts of Eastern Europe (e.g., Nigeria, Ethiopia, Argentina) contribute relatively fewer articles, signaling potential gaps in academic capacity or less research infrastructure dedicated to tourism.\n\nCountries with fewer publications (e.g., Bhutan, Morocco, Costa Rica) are often niche players, possibly engaged in specific tourism sectors or facing more localized research needs.\n\nResearch Diffusion and Specialization:\n\nCountries like Qatar, Kazakhstan, and Nepal show growing but still modest contributions. This suggests a broadening of tourism scholarship, especially in emerging markets or regions with developing tourism industries.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe data reveal a clear concentration of tourism research in a few regions such as China, the USA, Australia, and the UK, with emerging contributions from countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa. The varying article counts reflect global disparities in research focus, academic infrastructure, and regional tourism development.\nIn summary, the data point to established regions dominating tourism research while others are beginning to engage more actively. This highlights regional specialization and growing interest in tourism research worldwide, indicating the field’s broadening scope and diverse focus areas across the globe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregion\nFreq\n\n\n\n\nCHINA\n774\n\n\nUSA\n679\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\n287\n\n\nUK\n282\n\n\nSPAIN\n172\n\n\nPORTUGAL\n171\n\n\nSOUTH KOREA\n170\n\n\nINDIA\n105\n\n\nNEW ZEALAND\n82\n\n\nMALAYSIA\n81\n\n\nCANADA\n70\n\n\nITALY\n67\n\n\nTURKEY\n66\n\n\nSOUTH AFRICA\n63\n\n\nNETHERLANDS\n62\n\n\nBRAZIL\n54\n\n\nFINLAND\n40\n\n\nJAPAN\n38\n\n\nAUSTRIA\n35\n\n\nNORWAY\n33\n\n\nTHAILAND\n32\n\n\nFRANCE\n30\n\n\nINDONESIA\n28\n\n\nIRAN\n25\n\n\nGERMANY\n23\n\n\nPAKISTAN\n23\n\n\nVIETNAM\n20\n\n\nPOLAND\n19\n\n\nGHANA\n18\n\n\nSWITZERLAND\n18\n\n\nMEXICO\n17\n\n\nRUSSIA\n17\n\n\nSERBIA\n17\n\n\nSINGAPORE\n15\n\n\nCROATIA\n12\n\n\nSWEDEN\n12\n\n\nCYPRUS\n10\n\n\nHUNGARY\n10\n\n\nPHILIPPINES\n10\n\n\nSLOVENIA\n10\n\n\nBANGLADESH\n9\n\n\nCHILE\n9\n\n\nIRELAND\n9\n\n\nOMAN\n9\n\n\nCZECH REPUBLIC\n7\n\n\nEGYPT\n7\n\n\nETHIOPIA\n7\n\n\nJORDAN\n7\n\n\nESTONIA\n6\n\n\nFIJI\n6\n\n\nGREECE\n6\n\n\nSAUDI ARABIA\n6\n\n\nUKRAINE\n6\n\n\nICELAND\n5\n\n\nISRAEL\n5\n\n\nMAURITIUS\n5\n\n\nPERU\n5\n\n\nSRI LANKA\n5\n\n\nCOLOMBIA\n4\n\n\nNIGERIA\n4\n\n\nQATAR\n4\n\n\nARGENTINA\n3\n\n\nBULGARIA\n3\n\n\nDENMARK\n3\n\n\nJAMAICA\n3\n\n\nKAZAKHSTAN\n3\n\n\nNEPAL\n3\n\n\nPANAMA\n3\n\n\nBELGIUM\n2\n\n\nBHUTAN\n2\n\n\nBOTSWANA\n2\n\n\nCAMBODIA\n2\n\n\nNORTH MACEDONIA\n2\n\n\nROMANIA\n2\n\n\nRWANDA\n2\n\n\nTANZANIA\n2\n\n\nTUNISIA\n2\n\n\nURUGUAY\n2\n\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n2\n\n\nYEMEN\n2\n\n\nBRUNEI\n1\n\n\nCOSTA RICA\n1\n\n\nECUADOR\n1\n\n\nGEORGIA\n1\n\n\nGUINEA\n1\n\n\nKUWAIT\n1\n\n\nLITHUANIA\n1\n\n\nMOROCCO\n1\n\n\nNICARAGUA\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountires’ Production over Time\n\nDescription\n\n\nUSA\n\nThe USA shows a gradual increase in publications from 1992 (1 article) to 2025 (679 articles).\nA significant surge begins around 2010, with output increasing from 26 articles in 2010 to 377 articles in 2021.\nPost-2020, the USA maintains strong growth, producing 314 articles in 2020, 457 in 2022, and 650 articles in 2024.\n\nChina\n\nChina starts with almost no publications until 2007 (2 articles), then gradually ramps up in the following years.\nIn recent years, China has seen explosive growth, with 272 articles in 2021, 340 in 2022, and 485 in 2023.\n\nBy 2025, China is projected to produce 774 articles, surpassing the USA.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe UK also sees a steady increase, especially from 2016 (33 articles) to 2025 (282 articles).\n\nA significant jump in production occurs after 2019 as the UK’s article output reaches 94 in 2020 and 154 in 2022.\n\nAustralia\n\nAustralia shows consistent growth from 2006 (1 article) to 287 articles in 2025.\nA major increase occurs in the last decade, from 38 articles in 2016 to 227 articles in 2023, with projections to exceed 282 articles in 2024.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSouth Korea shows a modest but steady rise, starting from 4 articles in 2003 to 170 articles in 2025.\nThe output grows rapidly starting around 2018, with 53 articles in 2019 and 68 in 2020, peaking at 166 articles in 2024.\n\nPortugal\n\nPortugal starts with very few articles and slowly increases production after 2013.

Cited Countries\n\nDescription\n\n\nTop Cited Countries:\n\nUSA leads with a total of 12,019 citations, with an average of 46 citations per article.\n\nChina (6,727 citations, 22.1 citations per article) and the United Kingdom (4,930 citations, 42.5 citations per article) are the next most cited countries.\n\nOther high-impact countries include Italy (average 50.2 citations), Malaysia (45.2 citations), and Hungary (75.4 citations), which show strong citation rates relative to their number of articles.\n\nModerate Citation Countries:\n\nAustralia (3,613 citations, 33.8 citations per article), Korea (2,719 citations, 34 citations per article), and Spain (1,890 citations, 25.9 citations per article) also have a solid citation output but at a lower rate compared to the leading countries.\n\nCountries with Lower Citations:\n\nPortugal (605 citations, 11.4 citations per article) and South Africa (161 citations, 13.4 citations per article) have a lower total citation count, which may be due to fewer articles or a more recent entry into the tourism research field.\n\nNiche or Emerging Contributors:\n\nCountries like Mauritius (99 citations, 99 citations per article), Estonia (94.5 citations per article), and United Arab Emirates (90 citations per article) have high average citation counts, despite publishing fewer articles, reflecting their emerging prominence in niche areas of tourism research.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nHigh Citation Countries (USA, China, UK):\n\nThe USA, China, and United Kingdom are clearly the dominant players in the tourism research field. The USA’s total citation count is significantly higher, reflecting its well-established research infrastructure, extensive tourism industry, and academic influence.\nChina’s growth in citations reflects its expanding importance as a global tourism destination and the growing academic focus on Chinese tourism-related studies.\n\nCountries with High Citations per Article:\n\nHungary, UAE, and Estonia stand out with high citations per article, suggesting that their contributions, while fewer, are highly influential in the field. These countries may be publishing fewer articles, but those that are published have a strong impact on the academic discourse.\n\nBalanced Citation-Production Relationship:\n\nAustralia and Korea show a steady output with a reasonable number of citations per article. This suggests a healthy level of international recognition for their work, with a growing academic presence in tourism studies.\n\nModerate to Low Citation Impact in Some Regions:\n\nCountries such as South Africa, Portugal, Thailand, and India show relatively lower citation counts. This could reflect smaller research outputs or the recent growth of their tourism research communities.\nCountries like Vietnam, Greece, and Sri Lanka have low citation counts, potentially due to their more niche or emerging status in global tourism research.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe data reveal a clear dominance of countries like the USA, China, and the UK in terms of total citations, with Italy, Malaysia, and Hungary standing out for their high citation per article ratios. Emerging countries such as Mauritius and Estonia demonstrate significant influence relative to their article output, suggesting targeted contributions to key areas of tourism research.\nIn summary, the global tourism research landscape is highly concentrated in a few countries but also features significant contributions from niche and emerging regions with increasing academic influence. The USA, China, and the UK continue to lead, while smaller countries are gaining momentum, particularly in specific research areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nTC\nAverage.Article.Citations\n\n\n\n\nUSA\n12019\n46.0\n\n\nCHINA\n6727\n22.1\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\n4930\n42.5\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\n3613\n33.8\n\n\nKOREA\n2719\n34.0\n\n\nSPAIN\n1890\n25.9\n\n\nITALY\n1807\n50.2\n\n\nNETHERLANDS\n1270\n55.2\n\n\nNEW ZEALAND\n1218\n38.1\n\n\nINDIA\n1145\n23.9\n\n\nMALAYSIA\n1129\n45.2\n\n\nCANADA\n841\n25.5\n\n\nFINLAND\n622\n34.6\n\n\nPORTUGAL\n605\n11.4\n\n\nAUSTRIA\n456\n25.3\n\n\nTURKEY\n416\n14.3\n\n\nJAPAN\n401\n23.6\n\n\nHUNGARY\n377\n75.4\n\n\nTHAILAND\n314\n20.9\n\n\nISRAEL\n284\n71.0\n\n\nSWITZERLAND\n278\n23.2\n\n\nU ARAB EMIRATES\n270\n90.0\n\n\nMEXICO\n268\n33.5\n\n\nIRAN\n255\n25.5\n\n\nSLOVENIA\n222\n55.5\n\n\nNORWAY\n214\n17.8\n\n\nMAURITIUS\n198\n99.0\n\n\nESTONIA\n189\n94.5\n\n\nSOUTH AFRICA\n161\n13.4\n\n\nGERMANY\n155\n19.4\n\n\nSWEDEN\n148\n29.6\n\n\nFRANCE\n132\n16.5\n\n\nSERBIA\n111\n18.5\n\n\nCYPRUS\n104\n17.3\n\n\nBRAZIL\n100\n5.3\n\n\nPAKISTAN\n96\n19.2\n\n\nVIETNAM\n74\n10.6\n\n\nINDONESIA\n68\n7.6\n\n\nPOLAND\n55\n6.1\n\n\nDENMARK\n53\n26.5\n\n\nIRELAND\n52\n17.3\n\n\nRUSSIA\n46\n11.5\n\n\nSINGAPORE\n40\n13.3\n\n\nROMANIA\n32\n32.0\n\n\nCROATIA\n29\n4.1\n\n\nBANGLADESH\n28\n9.3\n\n\nGHANA\n25\n6.2\n\n\nFIJI\n21\n10.5\n\n\nICELAND\n20\n10.0\n\n\nPHILIPPINES\n20\n10.0\n\n\nUZBEKISTAN\n19\n19.0\n\n\nJORDAN\n18\n6.0\n\n\nPANAMA\n18\n9.0\n\n\nBELGIUM\n17\n17.0\n\n\nBOTSWANA\n14\n14.0\n\n\nOMAN\n14\n3.5\n\n\nTANZANIA\n13\n13.0\n\n\nNEPAL\n10\n5.0\n\n\nSAUDI ARABIA\n10\n5.0\n\n\nBHUTAN\n8\n8.0\n\n\nCZECH REPUBLIC\n6\n2.0\n\n\nTUNISIA\n6\n6.0\n\n\nBULGARIA\n5\n2.5\n\n\nARGENTINA\n4\n4.0\n\n\nNIGERIA\n4\n2.0\n\n\nSRI LANKA\n4\n2.0\n\n\nBRUNEI\n3\n3.0\n\n\nCHILE\n3\n3.0\n\n\nCOLOMBIA\n2\n1.0\n\n\nJAMAICA\n2\n2.0\n\n\nMACEDONIA\n2\n2.0\n\n\nGREECE\n1\n0.5\n\n\nPERU\n1\n0.5\n\n\nUKRAINE\n1\n1.0\n\n\nURUGUAY\n1\n1.0\n\n\nECUADOR\n0\n0.0\n\n\nEGYPT\n0\n0.0"

These documents span a range of publication years and include both seminal and more recent contributions.\nCitation Metrics:\n\nTotal Citations (TC) vary widely—from documents with over 700 citations (e.g., SHARPLEY R, 2014 with 704 TC) to those in the lower range (e.g., several papers with TC around 10–20).\nCitations per Year (TC per Year) show how frequently a paper is cited on an annual basis. Notably, some recent documents (e.g., ZHENG DN, 2021 with 97.6 TC per Year) have very high annual citation rates, suggesting rapid recognition.\nNormalized TC adjusts citation counts for factors such as publication age, highlighting the relative impact. Here, values range significantly—for instance, ZHENG DN, 2021 has a normalized TC of 16.27, whereas others are below 1, indicating that some papers are far more influential relative to their publication time.\n\nJournal Sources and Authorship:\nThe documents are published in well-regarded journals (e.g., Annals of Tourism Research, Journal of Travel Research, Tourism Management) and represent contributions from prominent authors, reinforcing their status as key works in the field.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nSeminal Contributions:\nPapers with very high total citations and normalized scores (e.g., SHARPLEY R, 2014 and ZHENG DN, 2021) are likely to be seminal studies. Their high TC per Year values further suggest that these works have had a strong and sustained impact over time.\nRapid Uptake of Recent Research:\nSome recent publications show impressive annual citation rates. For example, ZHENG DN, 2021 achieves 97.6 citations per year, which, when normalized, indicates an exceptional influence compared to peers published in similar time frames.\nRelative Impact Variability:\nThe wide range in normalized TC values reflects differences in how papers perform relative to the expected citation rate for their publication age. Documents with normalized TC values well above 1 are outperforming the typical citation benchmarks in tourism research.\nField Evolution:\nThe mix of older, highly cited documents with more recent works that are rapidly accumulating citations illustrates the dynamic evolution of tourism research. It underscores that while foundational works continue to be referenced, innovative new studies are also making significant impacts.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe analysis of the most globally cited documents in tourism research reveals a heterogeneous but influential set of publications. Key papers—such as those by SHARPLEY R (2014) and ZHENG DN (2021)—demonstrate both high cumulative and annual citation metrics, marking them as seminal contributions. The normalized citation scores further confirm that some documents have an impact far exceeding the norm for their publication period. In summary, this bibliometric snapshot highlights not only the long-standing foundational studies in tourism research but also emerging works that are rapidly shaping the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper\nDOI\nTotal.Citations\nTC.per.Year\nNormalized.TC\n\n\n\n\nSHARPLEY R, 2014, TOURISM MANAGE\n10.1016/j.tourman.2013.10.007\n704\n58.6666667\n8.5636087\n\n\nDEL BOSQUE IR,

The table below provides key metrics for each document including: - Local Citations: Citations received within the local (disciplinary or community-specific) dataset. - Global Citations: Total citations received worldwide. - Ratio: The percentage of local citations relative to global citations. - Normalized Local/Global Citations: Citation counts that have been adjusted (typically by publication age) to allow fairer comparisons across documents.\n\nDescription\n\n\nCitation Distribution\n\nThe documents show a wide variation in both local and global citations. For instance, UYSAL M, 2016, TOURISM MANAGE received 256 local and 554 global citations, whereas other papers in the lower part of the list have local citations as low as 1–2.\nThe Ratio (Local/Global × 100) ranges broadly. Some documents (e.g., UYSAL M, 2016) have a ratio near 46%, meaning nearly half of their citations come from the local community, while others (e.g., SHARPLEY R, 2014) have a lower ratio (~16%), indicating a greater share of citations coming from outside the local context.\n\nNormalized Citation Metrics\n\nThe Normalized Local Citations vary from below 1 to over 14, and the Normalized Global Citations range similarly. These numbers adjust for factors like publication age so that more recent papers are compared fairly with older, more established works.\nFor example, VADA S, 2020, TOUR MANAG PERSPECT shows a high normalized local citation (13.43) compared to a normalized global citation of 3.89, suggesting a very strong local impact relative to its overall citation performance.\n\nPublication Year Spread\n\nThe sample spans from earlier publications (e.g., 2004) to recent works (projected up to 2025). Older documents tend to accumulate higher absolute citation counts, but normalization helps reveal their relative impact when accounting for the time available to be cited.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nLocal vs. Global Impact\n\nA high Local/Global Ratio implies that a document is especially influential within its local research community. For instance, UYSAL M (2016) with a ratio of 46.2% indicates that nearly half of its influence is local.\nConversely, documents with a lower ratio (e.g., SHARPLEY R, 2014 at 16.3%) may have broader global appeal and are cited more by researchers outside the immediate field.\n\nNormalized Citation Insights\n\nThe normalized metrics help in comparing documents of different ages. A high normalized local citation value (such as that for VADA S, 2020) highlights a paper that, despite being newer, has achieved substantial local recognition.\nIn some cases, normalized global citations remain high (e.g., SHARPLEY R, 2014 and KIM K, 2013), indicating that these documents not only serve as core references in the local community but also enjoy widespread international attention.\n\nVariability Across Documents\n\nThe variation in both absolute and normalized citation metrics suggests diversity in research impact. Some papers achieve a strong local resonance while others gain more global recognition.\nThe distribution also reflects disciplinary differences and possibly the evolving citation practices within the field over time.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nConclusion:\nThe analysis of the most locally cited documents reveals distinct patterns of impact. Some documents (e.g., UYSAL M, 2016) are highly influential within the local research community, as evidenced by a high local-to-global citation ratio and strong normalized local citation scores. In contrast, other seminal works such as SHARPLEY R, 2014 are characterized by a lower local ratio, indicating broader international recognition. The normalized metrics further allow us to compare documents across different publication years, highlighting both enduring and emerging contributions.\nSummary:\n- Pattern: Wide variability in local and global citations with ratios ranging from ~16% to over 46%. Normalized metrics adjust for publication age, revealing the relative local and global impacts. - Interpretation: Documents with higher local ratios demonstrate stronger influence within the field’s core community, while those with lower ratios are more globally cited. Normalized values help identify papers that have rapidly accumulated impact relative to their age. - Overall: This bibliometric snapshot underscores the dual dimensions of research influence—local and global—and highlights the dynamic and multifaceted nature of scholarly impact in tourism research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument\nDOI\nYear\nLocal.Citations\nGlobal.Citations\nRatio\nNormalized.Local.Citations\nNormalized.Global.Citations\n\n\n\n\nUYSAL M, 2016, TOURISM

Distribution:\n\nA few foundational works (e.g., Fornell, 1981 with 272 citations; Uysal, 2016 with 256 citations; Hair, 2010 with 240 citations) dominate the citation counts.\nMany other references have citations ranging from the low teens up to around 70, indicating a long tail of influential but less‐cited works.\n\nMultidisciplinary Influences:\n\nThe list includes works from marketing research (e.g., Fornell, 1981; Hair, 2010), psychology (e.g., Maslow, 1943; Kahneman, 2004), and tourism/hospitality (e.g., Uysal, 2016; Chen, 2013).\nThis suggests that local scholarship in tourism draws on a wide range of theories and methodologies.\n\nSeminal Theoretical and Methodological Contributions:\n\nMany references are recognized as key sources for measurement instruments and conceptual frameworks (e.g., the works on structural equation modeling, quality-of-life, and satisfaction).\nSeveral classic texts (e.g., Maslow’s works, Seligman’s writings, and foundational works on social indicators) continue to influence current research.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCentral Role of Seminal Works:\n\nThe highest cited references have become “canonical” in the field, serving as standard benchmarks and foundational theories that shape subsequent research.\nHigh citation counts for works like Fornell (1981) and Uysal (2016) indicate their wide acceptance and use in building and validating measurement models and conceptual frameworks in tourism research.\n\nInterdisciplinary Nature of Research:\n\nThe diversity of sources (from marketing and psychology to tourism and hospitality) highlights the interdisciplinary nature of research in this domain.\nThis integration enriches the field by providing multiple perspectives and robust methodological approaches.\n\nEnduring Influence and Evolving Scholarship:\n\nMany older references (e.g., seminal articles from the 1980s and 1990s) remain highly cited, which underscores their enduring influence.\nNewer works, though cited less in absolute terms, are contributing to contemporary debates and methodologies, as seen with recent articles from 2020 and 2021.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nConclusion:\nThe most locally cited references reveal a heavily skewed distribution where a few seminal works dominate the landscape. These influential texts span across several disciplines, indicating the interdisciplinary foundation of tourism and hospitality research. They serve as both the theoretical and methodological bedrock of the field, guiding current studies and the development of new frameworks.\nSummary:\n- Pattern:\n- A small number of foundational works receive very high citation counts, while many other important references are cited at levels between 10 and 70. - The references encompass a broad range of disciplines, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of tourism research. - Interpretation:\n- High citation counts point to the enduring impact of seminal studies in shaping measurement, theory, and practice. - The diverse disciplinary sources underline how tourism research integrates insights from psychology, marketing, and management. - Overall:\n- These locally cited references form the backbone of the scholarly community, serving as key resources that inform research design, methodology, and theoretical development in tourism and hospitality studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCited.References\nCitations\n\n\n\n\nFORNELL C, 1981, J MARKETING RES, V18, P39, DOI 10.2307/3151312\n272\n\n\nUYSAL M, 2016, TOURISM MANAGE, V53, P244, DOI 10.1016/J.TOURMAN.2015.07.013\n256\n\n\nHAIR J.F., 2010, MULTIVARIATE DATA ANALYSIS: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE, V7TH ED.\n240\n\n\nKIM K, 2013, TOURISM MANAGE, V36, P527, DOI 10.1016/J.TOURMAN.2012.09.005\n197\n\n\nANDERECK KL, 2011, J TRAVEL RES, V50, P248, DOI 10.1177/0047287510362918\n180\n\n\nMCCABE S, 2013, ANN TOURISM RES, V41, P42, DOI 10.1016/J.ANNALS.2012.12.001\n171\n\n\nGILBERT D, 2004, ANN TOURISM RES, V31, P103, DOI 10.1016/J.ANNALS.2003.06.001\n146\n\n\nSMITH MK, 2017, ANN TOURISM RES, V66, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.ANNALS.2017.05.006\n138\n\n\nWOO E, 2015, ANN TOURISM RES, V50, P84, DOI 10.1016/J.ANNALS.2014.11.001\n137\n\n\nPODSAKOFF PM, 2003, J APPL PSYCHOL, V88, P879, DOI 10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879\n133\n\n\nANDERECK KL, 2005, ANN TOURISM RES, V32, P1056, DOI 10.1016/J.ANNALS.2005.03.001\n130\n\n\nSIRGY MJ, 2011, J TRAVEL RES, V50, P261, DOI 10.1177/0047287510362784\n126\n\n\nRYAN RM, 2001, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V52, P141, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.PSYCH.52.1.141\n121\n\n\nAP J, 1992, ANN TOURISM RES, V19, P665, DOI 10.1016/0160-7383(92)90060-3\n117\n\n\nSHARPLEY R, 2014, TOURISM MANAGE, V42, P37, DOI 10.1016/J.TOURMAN.2013.10.007\n115\n\n\nDIENER E, 1984, PSYCHOL BULL, V95, P542, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.95.3.542\n111\n\n\nDIENER E, 1985, J PERS ASSESS, V49, P71, DOI 10.1207/S15327752JPA4901_13\n109\n\n\nDOLNICAR S, 2012, ANN TOURISM RES, V39, P59, DOI 10.1016/J.ANNALS.2011.04.015\n109\n\n\nANDERSON JC, 1988, PSYCHOL BULL, V103, P411, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.103.3.411\n107\n\n\nGURSOY D, 2002, ANN TOURISM RES, V29, P79, DOI 10.1016/S0160-7383(01)00028-7\n100\n\n\nNEAL J.

the spectroscopic techniques used in the physical sciences to analyze materials based on the spectrum of the radiation they emit or absorb.\n\nReference Spectrum: Just as a material has a unique spectrum in physical spectroscopy, a research paper or topic will have a unique “spectrum” of references it cites. This spectrum can give insight into the foundational works for that paper or topic, indicating which previous works are most influential or relevant.\nAnalysis: By examining the “spectra” (or citation patterns) of multiple papers or topics, one can identify trends, clusters, and gaps in the research landscape. This is analogous to how one might use spectroscopy to categorize and analyze different materials based on their spectral signatures.\nEvolution Over Time: Just as the spectrum of a star can tell us about its age and stage in the lifecycle, looking at the changing citation patterns or “spectra” over time can reveal how a field or topic has evolved. It can show which works have become foundational over time or which ones have fallen out of favor.\nIntensity & Peaks: In physical spectroscopy, the intensity of certain peaks in a spectrum can indicate the concentration of specific elements or compounds. Similarly, in bibliometrics, certain references might be cited much more frequently than others, indicating their centrality or importance to the field. These “peaks” in the citation spectrum can point to seminal works or pivotal authors in a domain.\nComparative Analysis: By comparing the “spectra” of different papers, topics, or even researchers, one can identify overlaps, synergies, and distinctions. This can be useful for interdisciplinary research, collaboration opportunities, or understanding the landscape of a broad field.\nAnomalies & Outliers: Sometimes, a spectrum will have unexpected peaks or features. In bibliometrics, unexpected citation patterns might indicate emerging areas of interest, interdisciplinary bridges, or even issues like citation cartels or excessive self-citation.\nApplication: Just as spectroscopy has practical applications in material identification, quality control, and more, bibliometric “spectroscopy” can be used for research evaluation, funding allocation, curriculum design, and other academic or research management tasks.\n\nIn essence, the concept of “References Spectroscopy” in bibliometrics is a metaphorical way of describing the deep analysis of citation patterns to understand the structure, evolution, and dynamics of scholarly research.\nThe “Reference publication year spectroscopy” (RPYS) is a method to analyze the age of cited references in a given publication set. It can reveal the seminal works and foundational literature within a topic or domain. Let’s break down and interpret the given data on the bibliometric analysis:\n\nDescription\n\n\nTime Range and Citation Counts:\n\nThe data spans from as early as 1749 to 2025.\nFor each publication year, the table lists the number of citations received.\nTwo difference metrics are provided:\n\ndiffMedian5: The difference relative to a 5-year median.\ndiffMedian: The difference relative to an overall median.\n\n\nSpectral Peaks:\n\nSome years show very high citation counts (e.g., 1988: 772 citations; 1999: 1701 citations; 2000: 2151 citations; 2010: 4595 citations; 2017: 6451 citations; 2020: 7480 citations).\nThese peaks indicate years in which particularly influential works were published.\n\nRecent Years and Decline:\n\nAfter 2020, citation counts drop significantly (e.g., 2021: 5502; 2022: 3648; 2023: 2525; 2024: 1057; 2025: 39).\nThis decline is expected for very recent years since newer publications have had less time to be cited.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nFoundational Works and Seminal Years:\n\nThe peaks in certain years represent “spectral signatures” of foundational works in the field. For example:\n\n1988 Peak (772 citations, diffMedian = 316): Suggests that seminal contributions published in 1988 have become critical reference points.\nLate 1990s to Early 2000s Peaks (1701–2151 citations): Indicate a period of high impact research that likely shaped current theories and methodologies.\n2010 and Beyond: The strong peak in 2010 (4595 citations) and subsequent increases through 2017 (6451 citations) highlight a modern wave of influential work.\n\n\nEvolution Over Time:\n\nThe “spectrum” shows how the influential literature evolves:\n\nEarly periods (18th and 19th centuries) contribute sparsely.\nModern scholarship (late 20th century onward) provides a concentrated set of seminal works that dominate the citation landscape.\n\n\nIntensity and Anomalies:\n\nThe intensity (i.e., the height of the peaks) points to the centrality of key publications.\n\nAbrupt declines in very recent years are less a sign of diminishing quality than a reflection of citation lag—newer articles have not yet had sufficient time to accumulate citations.\n\nComparative and Trend Analysis:\n\nBy comparing the citation “spectra” across time intervals, one can identify periods of rapid development or paradigm shifts in the field.\nThe data can also be used to spot potential anomalies or emerging trends when unusual peaks or valleys appear.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nConclusion:\nReference Publication Year Spectroscopy provides a “spectral fingerprint” of a research field by mapping the age distribution of cited literature. The analysis reveals that certain years—often corresponding to seminal publications—dominate the citation landscape. Over time, these peaks mark periods of high impact and foundational contributions, while the recent decline reflects the natural citation lag for new works.\nSummary:\n- Data Pattern:\n- A wide temporal range with a few distinct peaks that highlight seminal publication years. - Difference metrics (diffMedian5 and diffMedian) help accentuate these peaks relative to typical citation levels.\n\nInterpretation:\n\nHigh citation peaks indicate the publication years of works that have become cornerstones of the field.\nThe evolution of the spectrum shows how foundational literature

Frequent Words\nThe provided data lists the most relevant words and their occurrences in a bibliometric analysis related to the topic.\n\nDescription\n\n\nHigh-Frequency Terms:\n\nQuality-of-life (371 occurrences), satisfaction (326), and tourism (294) dominate the list. These high frequencies indicate that these topics are central to the research field.\nOther major terms include happiness (219), perceptions (204), attitudes (189), and impact (177).\n\nThematic Clusters:\n\nWell-Being and Quality: Words like quality-of-life, satisfaction, happiness, and life satisfaction suggest a strong focus on personal and communal well-being in the context of tourism.\nExperience and Behavior: The presence of terms such as experience, experiences, behavior, and behavioral intentions indicates an emphasis on how individuals experience tourism and the resulting behaviors.\nManagement and Service: Words like management, service quality, performance, and customer satisfaction highlight the operational and strategic side of tourism studies.\nSustainability and Community: Terms such as sustainable tourism, community, residents, destination, and conservation reflect the growing attention on environmental and social sustainability within the industry.\nMethodological and Theoretical Constructs: Other recurring words such as model, scale, pls-sem, and framework suggest the use of sophisticated methodological tools and theoretical frameworks in the literature.\n\nDistribution Characteristics:\n\nThe frequency distribution is highly skewed—a small number of key terms appear with very high frequency, while many terms cluster near the lower threshold (5–10 occurrences). This pattern is typical of bibliometric data and reflects the influence of Zipf’s law in language.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCentral Themes:\n\nQuality and Well-Being: The very high frequency of terms related to quality-of-life and satisfaction indicates that these concepts are the backbone of research in tourism and hospitality. Scholars are deeply invested in understanding how tourism affects personal and community well-being.\nExperiential and Behavioral Dimensions: Frequent use of terms such as experience, behavioral intentions, and perceptions underlines the importance of understanding both the subjective experiences of tourists and their subsequent behaviors.\nOperational Focus: Keywords such as management, service quality, and performance point to an emphasis on practical applications in tourism management, including improving service delivery and operational efficiency.\nSustainability and Social Impact: The appearance of sustainability-related terms (e.g., sustainable tourism, conservation, community participation) shows that environmental, social, and economic sustainability are critical issues being addressed in the field.\n\nMethodological Insights:\n\nThe presence of technical terms such as model, scale, and pls-sem suggests that advanced statistical and modeling techniques are widely applied in tourism research.\nThe spread of terms related to both qualitative (e.g., grounded theory, narratives) and quantitative (e.g., structural model, panel-data) methods indicates a mixed-methods approach in the literature.\n\nImplications for the Research Field:\n\nThe strong emphasis on quality-of-life, satisfaction, and experiential aspects implies that tourism research is not only concerned with economic outcomes but also with the social and psychological impacts of tourism.\nThe diversity of terms also highlights the interdisciplinary nature of the field, intersecting marketing, psychology, management, and sustainability studies.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nConclusion:\nThe word frequency analysis—our “word frequency spectroscopy”—reveals a dynamic and multifaceted research landscape. Central themes such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, and tourism experiences dominate the discourse, while a variety of supporting concepts (e.g., service quality, sustainability, behavioral intentions) underscore the field’s complexity and interdisciplinarity.\nSummary:\n- Pattern:\n- A few key terms appear very frequently, establishing the core focus of the literature. - The distribution follows a typical skewed pattern, with many terms clustering at lower frequencies. - Interpretation:\n- The prominence of well-being, experiential, and operational keywords signals that the field values both the subjective and objective aspects of tourism. - The methodological terms indicate robust, diverse approaches to researching these topics. - Overall Insight:\n- This “spectroscopy” of word frequencies helps identify the central pillars of the literature and guides researchers toward understanding the foundational themes, emerging trends, and interdisciplinary nature of tourism research.\nBy understanding these patterns, scholars and practitioners can better appreciate the evolution, current focus, and potential future directions of research in tourism and hospitality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWords\nOccurrences\n\n\n\n\nquality-of-life\n371\n\n\nsatisfaction\n326\n\n\ntourism\n294\n\n\nhappiness\n219\n\n\nperceptions\n204\n\n\nattitudes\n189\n\n\nimpact\n177\n\n\nexperience\n150\n\n\nhealth\n147\n\n\nmodel\n144\n\n\nexperiences\n134\n\n\nsupport\n108\n\n\nbehavior\n100\n\n\ntravel\n99\n\n\nimpacts\n96\n\n\nleisure\n86\n\n\nquality\n80\n\n\nbenefits\n78\n\n\nmanagement\n76\n\n\nperformance\n74\n\n\ndestination\n73\n\n\ncommunity\n72\n\n\nlife\n70\n\n\nmotivation\n68\n\n\nvacation\n66\n\n\nhospitality\n60\n\n\nparticipation\n59\n\n\nplace

specific words related to the topic over a span of two decades.\n\nDescription\n\n\nGeneral Upward Trend:\nAcross all key terms, there is a clear and steady increase in frequency over time. Starting from minimal occurrences in the early 2000s (with many zeros in 2001–2002), the numbers gradually climb with notable acceleration in later years.\nTerm-Specific Observations:\n\nQuality-of-life:\nInitially absent or very low in frequency, this term shows exponential growth—rising to 371 occurrences by 2025.\nSatisfaction and Tourism:\nBoth terms follow a similar upward trend, indicating sustained and growing interest in these aspects.\nHappiness and Perceptions:\nThese terms start at modest levels but also experience significant increases, reflecting the growing focus on emotional and cognitive dimensions within tourism research.\nAttitudes and Impact:\nThe steady rise in these terms suggests that researchers increasingly consider how tourism influences both attitudes and measurable impacts.\nExperience, Health, and Model:\nAlthough starting lower compared to other terms, the frequency of these words also increases, underscoring an expanding emphasis on experiential, health-related, and methodological dimensions.\n\nNotable Increases:\nA marked increase is visible from 2012 onward, likely reflecting an expanding body of research and the maturation of the field, where more nuanced aspects (such as health, models, and experiential quality) are examined.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nEmerging and Evolving Themes:\nThe upward trajectory across all key terms indicates a growth in both the quantity and depth of research within the domain.\n\nQuality-of-life and satisfaction—core to understanding the impacts of tourism—have become focal points, reflecting a shift toward evaluating tourism’s effects on personal and community well-being.\nThe rise in tourism itself signals the overall expansion of the field.\nIncreased attention to happiness, perceptions, and attitudes suggests that the subjective experiences of tourists and residents are receiving more scholarly attention.\nThe growth in the frequency of model and related methodological terms highlights the increasing use of sophisticated analytical and statistical methods (e.g., structural equation modeling, pls-sem) to study these phenomena.\n\nMaturation of Research:\nThe consistent increase in these key words over time suggests that the field has matured. Early studies laid the foundation, and later research builds on these seminal works to explore more complex, multidimensional issues.\nReflecting Broader Trends:\nThe rise in terms like quality-of-life, health, and experience can be linked to broader societal trends—such as a focus on well-being, lifestyle, and the holistic impacts of tourism. Similarly, the use of methodological terms indicates that researchers are continuously improving the rigor and robustness of their analyses.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nConclusion:\nThe time-series data of word frequencies clearly illustrate the evolution of research themes in the tourism domain. As the field grows, core themes such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, and tourism have seen substantial increases in their usage. This not only reflects a quantitative growth in publications but also indicates a qualitative shift toward more comprehensive, multidisciplinary inquiries into the effects and implications of tourism.\nSummary:\n- Pattern:\n- There is an overall upward trend in the frequency of all key terms from 2001 to 2025. - Early years show very low frequencies, while later years demonstrate robust usage of terms. - Interpretation:\n- The increasing frequencies of terms like quality-of-life, satisfaction, tourism, and happiness suggest that these are central, evolving themes in the literature. - The growth in methodological and conceptual terms (e.g., model, experience) indicates an evolution toward more sophisticated research designs. - Overall Insight:\n- The data serve as a “spectroscopic” fingerprint of the field, revealing how foundational themes have grown and diversified over time. This evolution reflects both the expansion of tourism research and its increasing complexity, aligning with broader trends in societal focus on well-being, sustainability, and consumer experience.\nThis analysis of word frequency over time provides valuable insights into how the research landscape has developed and where future scholarly efforts may be directed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nQUALITY-OF-LIFE\nSATISFACTION\nTOURISM\nHAPPINESS\nPERCEPTIONS\nATTITUDES\nIMPACT\nEXPERIENCE\nHEALTH\nMODEL\n\n\n\n\n2001\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n2002\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n2003\n2\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n2004\n3\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n2\n0\n\n\n2005\n3\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n2\n0\n\n\n2006\n4\n1\n2\n1\n0\n2\n0\n3\n2\n2\n\n\n2007\n4\n1\n3\n1\n0\n2\n0\n3\n2\n2\n\n\n2008\n5\n1\n6\n1\n0\n3\n2\n4\n2\n2\n\n\n2009\n5\n1\n8\n1\n0\n4\n2\n4\n2\n2\n\n\n2010\n6\n1\n10\n1\n0\n5\n2\n6\n2\n3\n\n\n2011\n6\n1\n10\n1\n0\n6\n3\n8\n3\n3\n\n\n2012\n8\n2\n15\n3\n3\n7\n4\n8\n6\n3\n\n\n2013\n13\n6\n20\n5\n7\n10\n7\n12\n8\n6\n\n\n2014\n19\n12\n25\n10\n11\n10\n8\n15\n10\n7\n\n\n2015\n26\n15\n31\n15\n15\n14\n11\n17\n15\n12\n\n\n2016\n44\n29\n40\n22\n27\n22\n13\n23\n21\n17\n\n\n2017\n69\n44\n48\n35\n36\n36\n14\n31\n27\n25\n\n\n2018\n84\n62\n58\n45\n47\n45\n22\n38\n37\n31\n\n\n2019\n111\n87\n75\n59\n63\n57\n32\n45\n47\n42\n\n\n2020\n146\n118\n98\n78\n85\n73\n45\n58\n64\n49\n\n\n2021\n188\n150\n128\n100\n111\n96\n64\n81\n84\n62\n\n\n2022\n230\n187\n165\n131\n128\n124\n81\n95\n101\n78\n\n\n2023\n286\n243\n216\n158\n159\n150\n119\n116\n116\n98\n\n\n2024\n360\n319\n286\n215\n201\n186\n168\n147\n141\n139\n\n\n2025\n371\n326\n294\n219\n204\n189\n177\n150\n147\n144\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrend Topics\n\nDescription\n\n\nWide Range of Topics:\nThe topics span from highly researched themes like quality-of-life, satisfaction, and tourism to more niche areas such as casino, connectedness, and social media.\nTemporal Distribution:\n\nEarlier Appearance: Some topics, like mood and patterns, show initial prominence around 2012–2013 with later median and Q3 years indicating continued relevance.\nLater Emergence: Key topics such as quality-of-life, perceptions, attitudes, satisfaction, tourism, and happiness have Q1 values around 2019–2020, with median and Q3 values extending to 2022–2024. This suggests these themes have become central and are driving recent research.\nSteady Themes: Other topics (e.g., leisure, vacation, social impacts) show a steady upward trend with their central tendency positioned in recent years.\n\nFrequency Variation:\n\nHigh-frequency topics (e.g., quality-of-life with 371 occurrences and satisfaction with 326) indicate major research drivers.\nLower-frequency topics (e.g., casino with 5 occurrences) may represent more specialized or emerging areas.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nEvolving Research Priorities:\nThe shift in the median and Q3 years toward the later part of the timeline for many key topics (such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, tourism, and happiness) suggests that the field has increasingly focused on the holistic and experiential aspects of tourism and its broader social and emotional impacts.\nEmergence of New Areas:\nTerms like social media and connectedness appear in the most recent quartiles, reflecting the impact of digital technologies and social networks on tourism research. Similarly, technology as a topic, though lower in frequency, is gaining traction in the later years.\nConsistent Themes:\nCore topics such as leisure, vacation, and travel have maintained consistent attention over the years, which indicates their foundational role in the research field. Their consistent appearance underscores the importance of understanding both the operational and experiential dimensions of tourism.\nImplications for Future Research:\nThe data suggest that while traditional topics remain critical, there is a growing interest in integrating digital and social dimensions (e.g., social media, connectedness) and exploring new angles on well-being (quality-of-life, self-determination) within the context of tourism and hospitality.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nConclusion:\nThe trend topics analysis reveals a clear evolution in research focus over the years. Traditional themes such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, tourism, and happiness have surged in importance in recent years, while emerging areas such as social media and connectedness signal the integration of digital dimensions into tourism research.\nSummary:\n- Pattern:\n- Many key terms have shifted toward later publication years, with medians and Q3 values in the 2020–2024 range. - High-frequency topics such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, and tourism dominate the recent landscape. - Interpretation:\n- The data indicate an evolving research focus from traditional tourism metrics to broader, more holistic measures of well-being and digital influence. - The steady rise of topics like leisure and vacation reinforces their enduring relevance. - Overall Insight:\n- The trend topics provide a “spectral” view of the field, highlighting both well-established and emerging themes. This evolution reflects the dynamic nature of tourism research as it adapts to societal changes, technological advancements, and new methodological approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nFrequency\nYear.(Q1)\nYear.(Median)\nYear.(Q3)\n\n\n\n\nmood\n12\n2012\n2014\n2020\n\n\ncasino\n5\n2014\n2014\n2018\n\n\npatterns\n12\n2013\n2015\n2020\n\n\nholiday\n7\n2014\n2015\n2020\n\n\nissues\n21\n2015\n2016\n2019\n\n\nvacations\n8\n2016\n2016\n2020\n\n\ngoals\n5\n2014\n2017\n2021\n\n\nlong-run\n5\n2016\n2017\n2020\n\n\nsegmentation\n14\n2016\n2018\n2023\n\n\ncycle\n13\n2015\n2018\n2020\n\n\ntravel experiences\n10\n2016\n2018\n2023\n\n\nhost perceptions\n28\n2017\n2019\n2022\n\n\nindicators\n15\n2016\n2019\n2023\n\n\nself-determination\n9\n2018\n2019\n2021\n\n\nleisure\n86\n2016\n2020\n2022\n\n\nvacation\n66\n2017\n2020\n2023\n\n\nsocial impacts\n39\n2016\n2020\n2022\n\n\nquality-of-life\n371\n2019\n2021\n2023\n\n\nperceptions\n204\n2019\n2021\n2023\n\n\nattitudes\n189\n2019\n2021\n2023\n\n\nsatisfaction\n326\n2019\n2022\n2024\n\n\ntourism\n294\n2019\n2022\n2024\n\n\nhappiness\n219\n2019\n2022\n2024\n\n\nimpact\n177\n2020\n2023\n2024\n\n\ntravel\n99\n2020\n2023\n2024\n\n\nhospitality\n60\n2021\n2023\n2024\n\n\ntechnology\n18\n2020\n2024\n2024\n\n\nsocial media\n16\n2022\n2024\n2024\n\n\nconnectedness\n10\n2023\n2024\n2024"

    "text": "Clustering\n\nClustering by Coupling\nBibliometric coupling occurs when two documents reference a common third document in their bibliographies. It’s a method used to understand and visualize the intellectual structure of a scientific field.\n\nTable1 Parameters:\n\nAnalysis of Documents using the CR (Cited References) field.\nThe analysis uses a single word (ngram = 1) as a term.\nThe labeling term used is ‘ID’.\nThe impact measure is local, meaning the citation scores are specific to this dataset and do not refer to global scores.\nStemming is set to false, which means words in their base form were not merged (e.g., ‘running’, ‘runner’, and ‘ran’ are treated as distinct words).\nThe size of 0.3 might refer to the size of the nodes or clusters in a visualization (if one exists).\nCommunity repulsion and repel are both set to zero or false, which means there is no repulsion force in the clustering process. This could have implications for the layout of a network visualization.\nWalktrap is the clustering method used. Walktrap is a method that identifies communities (or clusters) in networks by simulating random walks.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThese parameters tell us that the bibliocoupling analysis focused on a set of 250 documents. Only references cited at least 7 times were considered, and the local citation impact was used to weigh the coupling. The walktrap clustering algorithm was chosen to detect communities (clusters) among documents.\nAll the documents in Table 2 are assigned to Cluster 1, indicating that—under the chosen coupling criteria—they share a similar citation footprint. The NormalizedLocalCitationScore gives an idea of each document’s local impact within this cluster. Higher scores (for example, above 5) may indicate that these works are central in this group, while lower scores indicate a more peripheral position.\nThe labels are created by extracting key words that most frequently appear within the coupled documents. For instance, in Cluster 1 the dominant topics appear to be “quality-of-life,” “satisfaction,” and “perceptions.” The “conf” values (for “confidence”) indicate the proportion with which these words characterize the cluster. In Cluster 2, terms such as “satisfaction,” “tourism,” and “happiness” define the group. The frequency (number of documents or occurrences), centrality (how central this cluster is within the network), and impact (aggregate local impact) help to compare the importance of each cluster. The color codes can be used to visually distinguish clusters in network visualizations.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCluster Formation:\n\nThe bibliocoupling analysis shows that a large portion of the 250 documents (as seen in Table 2) belong to a single dominant cluster (Cluster 1), suggesting a high degree of shared references among these works. The cluster is characterized by themes related to quality-of-life, satisfaction, and perceptions—a reflection of a common intellectual basis in tourism and hospitality research.\n\nCluster Labels and Themes:\n\nTable 3 provides a “spectral” overview of clusters by summarizing the key themes. Different clusters (here, four groups are shown) have distinctive profiles:\n\nGroups\n\nGroup 1: Emphasizes quality-of-life, satisfaction, and perceptions.\nGroup 2: Highlights satisfaction, tourism, and happiness.\nGroup 3: Focuses on tourism as well as quality-of-life and satisfaction (but with a different balance).\nGroup 4: Indicates a blend where quality-of-life and happiness are important alongside satisfaction.\n\nApplication: Such an analysis can help researchers identify the intellectual foundations of the field, pinpoint seminal works, and recognize the evolution of research topics over time. It also facilitates the discovery of potential gaps, emerging clusters, or the need for interdisciplinary bridges.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nIn summary, this bibliocoupling analysis—through document clustering—provides a detailed “map” of how research in tourism, quality-of-life, satisfaction, and related fields is interconnected. The parameters (Table 1) set the stage for the analysis, Table 2 shows the membership and impact of individual works within a cluster, and Table 3 synthesizes the thematic essence of each cluster, offering insights into the structure and evolution of the research landscape."

    "text": "Conceptual Structure\n\nNetwork Approach\n\nCo-occurence Network\n\nDescription\n\n\nCluster 1:\n\nIncludes keywords such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, perceptions, attitudes, impact, support, management, destination, community, and so forth. These terms emphasize conceptual and socio-psychological aspects of tourism research (e.g., quality-of-life outcomes, satisfaction constructs, community support, and destination management).\n\nCluster 2:\n\nIncludes keywords such as tourism, happiness, experience, health, behavior, travel, leisure, motivation, vacation, hospitality, emotions, service quality, etc.\n\nThese terms tend to focus on traveler-centric topics such as tourist behavior, happiness, well-being, and experiential dimensions of tourism and hospitality.\nEach node is measured by three main centrality metrics:\n\nBetweenness: How often a keyword lies on the shortest path between two other keywords. High betweenness = strong “bridging” or “brokerage” role.\nCloseness: How close a keyword is to all other keywords in the network. High closeness = the keyword can quickly “reach” many others.\nPageRank: A measure of overall importance or influence in the network. High PageRank = a keyword is frequently linked or co-occurs with other influential terms.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nCluster 1 Highlights\n\n\nQuality-of-life (Betweenness = 71.51, PageRank = 0.0720)\n\nThis has the highest betweenness and highest PageRank in the entire network, indicating it is a major “bridge” and a core concept.\nHigh betweenness means quality-of-life connects multiple subtopics, bridging them within tourism research.\nHigh PageRank underscores its frequent and influential co-occurrences with other key words like satisfaction, perceptions, and attitudes.\n\nSatisfaction (Betweenness = 61.36, PageRank = 0.0684)\n\nAnother highly central term, signifying it often co-occurs with quality-of-life and perceptions.\nIts role in bridging subtopics is second only to quality-of-life, reflecting the strong interplay between satisfaction constructs and broader tourism impacts.\n\nPerceptions (Betweenness = 22.47, PageRank = 0.0441) and Attitudes (Betweenness = 19.09, PageRank = 0.0420)\n\nBoth show moderate to high betweenness and are conceptually linked to how stakeholders (e.g., residents, tourists) perceive tourism’s impacts and outcomes.\nThey often appear in studies focusing on local community or tourist viewpoints.\n\nImpact / Impacts (Betweenness ~16, PageRank ~0.03)\n\nReiterates the thematic emphasis on understanding how tourism affects communities, well-being, and destination development.\n\nIn sum, Cluster 1 focuses on macro-level and conceptual themes such as quality-of-life, satisfaction, and stakeholder perceptions. The high bridging role of quality-of-life and satisfaction suggests these are pivotal, unifying concepts in tourism research.\n\n\nCluster 2 Highlights\n\n\nTourism (Betweenness = 29.29, PageRank = 0.0445) and Happiness (Betweenness = 28.09, PageRank = 0.0453)\n\nThese have the highest betweenness in Cluster 2, indicating they frequently link subtopics related to personal well-being, experiences, and behavior.\n\nExperience / Experiences (Betweenness ~14, PageRank ~0.0317) and Health (Betweenness ~8.62, PageRank ~0.0292)\n\nEmphasize the experiential and well-being dimensions of tourism.\nExperience is a core bridging term for traveler-centric research, while health underscores the growing interest in wellness, mental health, and stress recovery.\n\nBehavior (Betweenness = 5.54, PageRank = 0.0224), Travel (Betweenness = 3.64, PageRank = 0.0202), Leisure (Betweenness = 3.37, PageRank = 0.0205)\n\nReflect the micro-level, individual consumer or traveler perspective—motivation, behavior, and leisure patterns.\n\nHospitality, Service Quality, Loyalty, Customer Satisfaction\n\nThese terms highlight the hospitality management dimension within tourism, focusing on how service experiences influence consumer loyalty and satisfaction.\n\nOverall, Cluster 2 is more oriented toward traveler well-being, emotions, experiences, and behavioral outcomes (e.g., loyalty, motivation, and health benefits). Tourism and happiness stand out as bridging concepts linking different aspects of the tourist experience and personal well-being.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\n\nTwo Thematic Cores:\n\n\nCluster 1: Macro-level constructs—quality-of-life, satisfaction, and perceptions—dominate. They connect strongly with impacts, community, management, and destination themes.\nCluster 2: Micro-level or traveler-centric themes—tourism, happiness, experience, health, and behavior—are central, highlighting well-being, motivation, leisure, and service quality.\n\n\nMost Influential Terms:\n\n\nQuality-of-life leads in betweenness and PageRank, serving as a key integrative concept bridging other themes.\nSatisfaction, tourism, and happiness also show high centrality, indicating they frequently co-occur with many keywords and serve as important nodes in the network.\n\n\nConceptual Bridge:\n\n\nThe co-word network shows that quality-of-life (Cluster 1) and tourism / happiness (Cluster 2) are major “bridges,” connecting socio-psychological aspects (perceptions, attitudes, impacts) with personal experience dimensions (health, motivation, leisure).\n\n\nPractical Implication:\n\n\nResearchers focusing on policy and strategic planning may gravitate toward Cluster 1 concepts (e.g., quality-of-life, satisfaction, community impacts).\nScholars exploring traveler behavior, well-being, and experiential marketing will likely anchor in Cluster 2 (tourism, happiness, experience, health).\nConclusion:\n\nThe co-word network reveals two robust thematic poles in tourism research: one anchored in quality-of-life and satisfaction at the macro/community level, and the other in tourism, happiness, and health at the traveler experience level. High-betweenness terms (e.g., quality-of-life, satisfaction, tourism, happiness) serve as critical links across subfields, indicating these keywords are central to the ongoing dialogue in tourism and hospitality scholarship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode\nCluster\nBetweenness\nCloseness\nPageRank\n\n\n\n\nquality-of-life\n1\n71.50555996\n0.01923077\n0.072007839\n\n\nsatisfaction\n1\n61.36116652\n0.01960784\n0.068423056\n\n\nperceptions\n1\n22.47400947\n0.01960784\n0.044104102\n\n\nattitudes\n1\n19.09051419\n0.01886792\n0.041976122\n\n\nimpact\n1\n16.09042793\n0.01923077\n0.033421084\n\n\nmodel\n1\n14.70315216\n0.02040816\n0.031379442\n\n\nsupport\n1\n5.28881256\n0.01639344\n0.027270317\n\n\nimpacts\n1\n1.98943940\n0.01492537\n0.020753606\n\n\nmanagement\n1\n1.21270369\n0.01538462\n0.013463103\n\n\nperformance\n1\n2.71185040\n0.01724138\n0.014511253\n\n\ndestination\n1\n2.69455667\n0.01724138\n0.016888536\n\n\ncommunity\n1\n2.77949035\n0.01639344\n0.017234390\n\n\nparticipation\n1\n1.41306468\n0.01612903\n0.013342324\n\n\nplace attachment\n1\n1.96921720\n0.01639344\n0.016049657\n\n\ntourism development\n1\n0.15064032\n0.01298701\n0.009730973\n\n\nsustainable tourism\n1\n0.37027872\n0.01333333\n0.010818812\n\n\nimage\n1\n1.10824682\n0.01587302\n0.011375787\n\n\nsocial impacts\n1\n0.58149154\n0.01351351\n0.010346093\n\n\nframework\n1\n0.51975513\n0.01492537\n0.009322623\n\n\nattachment\n1\n0.47362180\n0.01388889\n0.010328885\n\n\nresidents perceptions\n1\n0.09939396\n0.01234568\n0.009114786\n\n\nidentity\n1\n0.47761152\n0.01470588\n0.008931140\n\n\ntourism\n2\n29.29428826\n0.01960784\n0.044456950\n\n\nhappiness\n2\n28.09026661\n0.01960784\n0.045319054\n\n\nexperience\n2\n13.94918967\n0.01886792\n0.031701368\n\n\nhealth\n2\n8.62428021\n0.01851852\n0.029196663\n\n\nexperiences\n2\n4.94560860\n0.01785714\n0.023920834\n\n\nbehavior\n2\n5.53508888\n0.01851852\n0.022410710\n\n\ntravel\n2\n3.63723052\n0.01754386\n0.020176020\n\n\nleisure\n2\n3.37247458\n0.01666667\n0.020520597\n\n\nquality\n2\n3.83654392\n0.01724138\n0.018553080\n\n\nbenefits\n2\n1.84968372\n0.01639344\n0.017138772\n\n\nlife\n2\n1.21081475\n0.01562500\n0.014353467\n\n\nmotivation\n2\n1.60064297\n0.01612903\n0.015277252\n\n\nvacation\n2\n1.65098250\n0.01538462\n0.017071013\n\n\nhospitality\n2\n0.69101276\n0.01492537\n0.011972105\n\n\nantecedents\n2\n1.45442394\n0.01587302\n0.013401872\n\n\nbehavioral intentions\n2\n1.54899142\n0.01562500\n0.014920073\n\n\ninvolvement\n2\n0.71617880\n0.01515152\n0.012721996\n\n\nwork\n2\n0.52799138\n0.01428571\n0.011183457\n\n\nauthenticity\n2\n0.41854427\n0.01492537\n0.010309238\n\n\nemotions\n2\n2.37330038\n0.01666667\n0.013940212\n\n\nmotivations\n2\n0.24362944\n0.01351351\n0.009674260\n\n\nservice quality\n2\n0.86218217\n0.01449275\n0.011370385\n\n\npositive psychology\n2\n0.17645801\n0.01388889\n0.009743053\n\n\nloyalty\n2\n0.80103942\n0.01492537\n0.012104113\n\n\nconsumption\n2\n0.23035039\n0.01369863\n0.008721654\n\n\nlife satisfaction\n2\n0.53725025\n0.01449275\n0.008854840\n\n\nscale\n2\n0.21597822\n0.01449275\n0.009989162\n\n\ncustomer satisfaction\n2\n0.54056896\n0.01388889\n0.010203870\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThematic Map\nBased on the provided data, it appears to be a bibliometric analysis of the term. Bibliometric analysis is used to quantify and analyze published literature on a particular topic, often to identify the most prevalent themes, authors, and journals. The data seems to be organized in a thematic map, detailing the occurrences and relevance of certain words or terms associated with the topic.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Thematic Map positions each cluster according to two metrics:\nCallon Centrality: How important or “central” a cluster is to the entire research domain. High centrality indicates the cluster is well-connected and influences many other themes. Callon Density: How internally cohesive or “dense” a cluster is. High density indicates the cluster’s themes are well-developed and strongly interconnected. Additionally, the bubble size corresponds to the frequency of topics within that cluster (i.e., how often these topics appear in the dataset).\nFrom the table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster\nCallon Centrality\nCallon Density\nRank Centrality\nRank Density\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n2.91\n13.25\n3\n4\n1932\n\n\nSatisfaction\n5.24\n10.38\n4\n2\n3244\n\n\nPerceptions\n1.99\n10.76\n2\n3\n1461\n\n\nQuality-of-Life\n1.78\n9.51\n1\n1\n866\n\n\n\n\nCluster 1: Health has high density (13.25) but moderate centrality (2.91).\nCluster 2: Satisfaction stands out for having the highest centrality (5.24) and a relatively high density (10.38).\nCluster 3: Perceptions shows moderate centrality (1.99) and density (10.76).\nCluster 4: Quality-of-Life has lower centrality (1.78) and density (9.51), as well as the smallest frequency (866).\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nHealth\n\n\nDensity (13.25): Indicates a well-developed, cohesive set of themes.\nCentrality (2.91): The cluster is moderately influential within the overall research landscape.\nFrequency (1932): There is a substantial volume of research, covering:\n\nWell-being, mental health, stress, physical activity, wellness tourism, and vacation benefits.\nTopics such as positive psychology, life satisfaction, stress, self-determination, and burnout frequently appear.\n\nInterpretation: Although not the most central cluster, “Health” is deeply explored and internally cohesive. It serves as a significant subfield, possibly appealing to scholars studying tourism’s role in stress reduction, wellness experiences, and overall well-being.\n\n\nSatisfaction\n\n\nDensity (10.38): Well-developed but not as dense as “Health.”\nCentrality (5.24): The highest among all clusters, indicating it is a key bridging concept for the entire domain.\nFrequency (3244): The largest volume of research. Core themes include:\n\nConsumer behavior, service quality, tourism experience, loyalty, behavioral intentions, motivation, and hospitality management.\nThe presence of strong “experience” and “modeling” keywords indicates robust quantitative and conceptual frameworks analyzing satisfaction-related outcomes.\n\nInterpretation: “Satisfaction” is pivotal to the domain. It connects to many other themes (e.g., loyalty, experience, perceived value), making it a central hub in tourism and hospitality research.\n\n\nPerceptions\n\n\nDensity (10.76): Similar to “Satisfaction” in density, indicating strong internal links.\nCentrality (1.99): Somewhat lower centrality compared to “Satisfaction,” but not marginal.\nFrequency (1461): Moderately sized. Key themes:\n\nAttitudes, community perceptions, residents’ support, sustainable tourism, social impacts, and management aspects.\nEmphasis on how locals, communities, and stakeholders perceive tourism’s impacts.\n\nInterpretation: “Perceptions” focuses on stakeholder attitudes (especially residents), community-level impacts, and sustainability. Its moderate centrality suggests it is more specialized than “Satisfaction” but remains an important dimension of tourism research.\n\n\nQuality-of-Life\n\n\nDensity (9.51): The lowest density, indicating it is less internally cohesive compared to the others.\nCentrality (1.78): Also relatively low, meaning it is less connected to other clusters.\nFrequency (866): The smallest cluster, yet thematically crucial. Key topics:\n\nSocio-economic impacts, well-being research, policy aspects, urban tourism, and city contexts.\nTerms like “heritage,” “choice,” “innovation,” and “rural tourism” appear, suggesting a broad range but less internal overlap.\n\nInterpretation: “Quality-of-Life” is foundational to tourism’s broader socio-economic discourse, linking well-being to policy and development. Despite lower centrality and density, it remains a conceptually important area, especially for strategic and policy-driven studies.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\n\nHealth (high density, moderate centrality): A strongly developed cluster focusing on well-being, mental health, stress, and physical activity in tourism contexts.\nSatisfaction (highest centrality, well-developed density): The dominant cluster bridging various subfields in tourism and hospitality—centered on consumer satisfaction, loyalty, and experience.\nPerceptions (moderate centrality, moderate-high density): Focused on stakeholder attitudes, community impacts, and sustainability. Emphasizes how local communities and other stakeholders perceive tourism’s effects.\nQuality-of-Life (lowest centrality and density, smaller size): Addresses broader socio-economic outcomes, well-being research, and policy concerns, providing a more macro-level perspective on how tourism influences overall life quality.\nThe Satisfaction cluster emerges as the most central—meaning it touches many other areas of tourism research—while Health is the most internally cohesive (highest density). Perceptions occupies a mid-range position, suggesting it is well-studied but less of a “bridge” than Satisfaction. Quality-of-Life appears more specialized, with fewer interconnections but important for strategic policy insights.\nThe thematic analysis reveals four major research clusters in the field: Health, Satisfaction, Perceptions, and Quality-of-Life.\nSatisfaction is the key bridging concept in tourism and hospitality studies, connecting with consumer behavior, loyalty, service quality, and experience-driven research.\nHealth is a well-established, highly cohesive cluster focusing on wellness and well-being, indicating a strong niche of scholarship.\nPerceptions revolve around how stakeholders and communities view tourism, highlighting attitudes, community support, and sustainable tourism.\nQuality-of-Life stands out for exploring policy, socio-economic, and macro-level impacts, though it is less interconnected with other clusters.\nOverall, these four clusters collectively structure the tourism and hospitality research landscape, reflecting both micro-level topics (e.g., satisfaction, well-being) and macro-level considerations (e.g., community perceptions, quality-of-life, policy). Future research may benefit from integrating these clusters, for instance, examining how quality-of-life outcomes tie into satisfaction drivers, or how community perceptions intersect with health-related tourism experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactorial Approach\n\nFactorial Analysis\nFactorial analysis is a statistical method used to identify the underlying relationships among a set of variables. Here, you’ve presented data for words (probably representing research themes or keywords) and documents (probably representing research papers) in two different dimensions (Dim.1 and Dim.2).\n\nDescription\n\n\nIn our dataset, 50+ keywords (e.g., “quality.of.life”, “satisfaction”, “tourism”, “happiness”, “perceptions”, etc.) were subjected to a factor analysis. Two factors (here labeled Dim1 and Dim2) emerged that account for a major part of the variance in the keywords’ co-occurrence patterns. For example:\n\nQuality.of.life shows a strong negative loading on Dim1 (–0.85) and near zero on Dim2.\nAttitudes and perceptions both load very negatively on Dim1 (–1.63 and –1.15, respectively), while other terms such as support (–1.86) and sustainable.tourism (–1.87) are also strongly negative on Dim1.\nIn contrast, words such as vacation (1.05 on Dim1 and 1.16 on Dim2), health (0.81, 0.87), leisure (0.81, 0.97) and life (0.96, 0.17) show strong positive values—especially on Dim1.\nSome terms are more prominent on Dim2: for example, happiness (0.47, 0.58) and experiences (0.5, 0.69) suggest an important emotional/experiential component.\n\nEach keyword’s coordinates on these two dimensions is thought to reflect underlying “latent” factors in how topics are discussed in the literature.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nAlthough interpretation in factor analysis can be somewhat subjective, the pattern of loadings suggests the following:\n\nDimension 1: “Value & Appraisal versus Critical/Contextual Factors”\n\nHigh positive loadings (e.g., “vacation,” “life,” “health,” “leisure”) indicate terms that are typically associated with positive experiential outcomes and well‐being.\nHigh negative loadings (e.g., “perceptions,” “attitudes,” “support,” “sustainable.tourism”) indicate concepts that may capture evaluative or critical aspects (for example, community or stakeholder concerns, or constructs that question the status quo).\nIn essence, Dim1 appears to differentiate research that emphasizes the positive, beneficial, or “value‐adding” aspects of tourism from work that focuses on critical or challenging perspectives (or even on the underlying cognitive–affective appraisals of tourism impacts).\n\nDimension 2: “Emotional-Experiential Intensity versus Structural/Process Aspects”\n\nHigher scores on Dim2 (e.g., “happiness,” “experiences,” “leisure,” “benefits”) suggest a focus on the intensity of affect, emotion, or subjective experience.\nIn contrast, keywords such as “model,” “service.quality,” “behavioral.intentions,” and “loyalty”—which load more strongly in the negative direction on Dim2—may be more concerned with evaluative, outcome‐oriented, or structural aspects of tourism research.\nThus, Dim2 can be seen as contrasting research that emphasizes the affective, emotional, and experiential side of tourism versus work that is more about measurement models, process evaluations, and outcome indicators.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\n\nTwo key dimensions emerged from the factor analysis on tourism–related keywords.\n\nDimension 1 appears to capture a continuum from positive experiential and well–being aspects (e.g., “vacation,” “health,” “leisure,” “life”) to more evaluative or critical constructs (e.g., “attitudes,” “perceptions,” “support,” “sustainable.tourism”).\nDimension 2 seems to distinguish between emotionally charged, experiential concepts (e.g., “happiness,” “experiences”) and those keywords that are more process‐ or model–oriented (e.g., “model,” “behavioral.intentions,” “service.quality”).\nAll keywords included in this analysis were part of a single cluster (Cluster 1), indicating that while there is one overall thematic grouping in the literature, two latent dimensions underlie how these themes interrelate.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe factor analysis reveals that within tourism research the scholarly discourse can be understood along two interrelated axes. One axis (Dim1) differentiates between constructs related to positive outcomes and quality of life versus those that reflect critical perceptions and contextual challenges. The other axis (Dim2) highlights the distinction between the intensity of emotional and experiential aspects and more structural, model-based, or outcome–focused measures.\nThis dual‐dimensional structure underscores the multifaceted nature of tourism research. Researchers and practitioners can use these insights to:\n\nBetter understand which concepts are central to different research traditions (e.g., studies of well–being versus evaluations of tourism impacts).\nGuide future investigations by clarifying which aspects (emotional vs. structural, positive vs. critical) remain underexplored or in need of deeper theoretical integration.\nInform policy and management decisions by recognizing that both subjective well–being and structural performance indicators are critical in evaluating the success and sustainability of tourism initiatives.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the latent dimensions identified through the factor analysis provide a nuanced picture of how keywords cluster around themes of quality-of-life and satisfaction, while also highlighting the role of emotional experience versus evaluative modeling in tourism research. This enhanced understanding can help orient future research and interdisciplinary dialogue within the field."

    "section": "Intellectual Structure",
    "text": "Intellectual Structure\n\nCo-citation Network\n\nDescription\n\nNetwork Structure and Clusters:\n\nCluster 1: This group includes documents such as Mccabe et al. (2013), Gilbert (2004), Smith (2017), Sirgy (2011), and several others. These works generally have moderate to low betweenness values (e.g., betweenness ranging from about 0.3 to 8) and closeness values around 0.012–0.015. Their PageRank scores (ranging roughly from 0.01 to 0.03) indicate that while they are cited together and contribute to a cohesive group, they are not the highest “bridging” documents in the network.\nCluster 2: Starting with nodes such as Kim K (2013), Andereck KL (2011), Woo E (2015), and others, Cluster 2 documents show very high betweenness values (e.g., 14–15 and even up to 27 in some cases) and relatively high closeness (around 0.014–0.017). Their PageRank scores (up to 0.036) indicate that these documents play a key role in linking various subfields or subtopics. This cluster likely represents a group of seminal or central works that many later studies reference together.\nCluster 3: The third cluster (which begins with Fornell (1981) and includes Uysal (2016), Hair (2010), Podsakoff (2003), etc.) has very high betweenness values (for instance, Fornell’s betweenness is over 130) and higher closeness values (around 0.017–0.019). Their PageRank scores are also higher (up to 0.03 or more). This cluster appears to capture highly influential and broadly recognized works that serve as intellectual hubs in the tourism literature.\n\nCentrality Measures:\n\nBetweenness Centrality: This measure reflects how often a document lies on the shortest path between other documents. Documents with high betweenness (e.g., those in Cluster 3) are considered “bridges” between different parts of the network, indicating they are crucial for connecting diverse research streams.\nCloseness Centrality: This value shows how close a document is to all other documents in the network. Most documents have closeness values in the narrow range (~0.012–0.019), suggesting that while there are differences, the network is relatively compact.\nPageRank: Higher PageRank values (e.g., those for some Cluster 3 documents) indicate that those papers are not only well‐cited but also cited by other well‐cited documents, underlining their broader influence within the literature.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nDistinct Intellectual Communities: The emergence of three clusters indicates that the field of tourism research is divided into at least three distinct intellectual communities or subfields. Each cluster groups together articles that tend to be cited together, suggesting that they share common themes or theoretical frameworks.\nInfluence and Bridging Roles: Documents in Cluster 3 (with very high betweenness and PageRank) appear to serve as key bridges, likely representing foundational or methodological works that have influenced multiple strands of tourism research. In contrast, Cluster 1 documents may be more specialized or represent a more coherent niche, while Cluster 2 contains influential works that are central to connecting topics within that niche.\nRole of Seminal Works: For instance, Fornell’s (1981) work in Cluster 3 has an exceptionally high betweenness centrality, marking it as a pivotal reference that links diverse research areas. Similarly, high betweenness scores in Cluster 2 (e.g., for Kim K (2013) and Andereck KL (2011)) suggest that these studies have had a substantial impact on subsequent research and are frequently co‐cited with a wide range of other documents.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe co‐citation network analysis reveals a structured landscape in tourism research where:\n\nCluster 1 comprises documents that form a specialized but cohesive group with moderate centrality values.\nCluster 2 consists of influential works that serve as important connectors within a subfield, having high betweenness and relatively high PageRank scores.\nCluster 3 includes seminal and widely influential documents that act as intellectual hubs, connecting diverse research streams across the field.\n\nConclusion: The network structure underscores the multidimensional nature of tourism research. High-centrality documents—particularly those in Cluster 3—are key for bridging theoretical, methodological, and empirical studies, thereby facilitating cross-fertilization between different research areas. In contrast, Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 represent more thematically coherent or specialized sub-communities. Recognizing these clusters and the roles of the central documents can guide researchers in identifying core literature, understanding the evolution of the field, and pinpointing potential areas for future interdisciplinary integration. This co‐citation analysis ultimately highlights both the diversity and the interconnectedness of scholarly work in tourism research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode\nCluster\nBetweenness\nCloseness\nPageRank\n\n\n\n\nmccabe s 2013\n1\n8.13567825\n0.01408451\n0.032791442\n\n\ngilbert d 2004\n1\n2.05093085\n0.01408451\n0.032306626\n\n\nsmith mk 2017\n1\n1.37376493\n0.01333333\n0.023630311\n\n\nsirgy mj 2011\n1\n2.57914711\n0.01408451\n0.028918060\n\n\nryan rm 2001\n1\n0.59041334\n0.01298701\n0.020672342\n\n\ndiener e 1984\n1\n2.94837075\n0.01408451\n0.021816705\n\n\ndiener e 1985\n1\n2.06211332\n0.01388889\n0.021563742\n\n\ndolnicar s 2012\n1\n2.20496151\n0.01388889\n0.023612545\n\n\nneal j. 2007\n1\n2.44262763\n0.01388889\n0.022355041\n\n\nkim h 2015\n1\n2.15748404\n0.01388889\n0.016424538\n\n\nneal jd 1999\n1\n1.10825137\n0.01333333\n0.020395104\n\n\nchen cc 2013\n1\n0.27368596\n0.01234568\n0.017925766\n\n\nvada s 2019\n1\n0.67929012\n0.01149425\n0.013663794\n\n\nnawijn j 2011\n1\n0.34075064\n0.01298701\n0.019849660\n\n\ntung vws 2011\n1\n0.27495571\n0.01136364\n0.014357017\n\n\nvada s 2020\n1\n0.25529349\n0.01190476\n0.014763601\n\n\ndiener e 1999\n1\n0.51843654\n0.01315789\n0.014341347\n\n\nnawijn j 2010\n1\n0.17675153\n0.01234568\n0.018132765\n\n\nknobloch u 2017\n1\n0.16742143\n0.01098901\n0.014845787\n\n\nbraun v 2021\n1\n0.10238199\n0.01136364\n0.005609378\n\n\nfilep s 2019\n1\n0.13495612\n0.01176471\n0.014760141\n\n\nnawijn j 2016\n1\n0.05179224\n0.01149425\n0.011975171\n\n\ncrompton j. 1979\n1\n0.08168483\n0.01136364\n0.011027585\n\n\nkim k 2013\n2\n14.49846610\n0.01428571\n0.036631436\n\n\nandereck kl 2011\n2\n15.31186170\n0.01408451\n0.033818137\n\n\nwoo e 2015\n2\n9.29655539\n0.01388889\n0.028082940\n\n\nnunkoo r 2012\n2\n5.22974580\n0.01428571\n0.024298426\n\n\nandereck kl 2005\n2\n3.91767709\n0.01408451\n0.026940570\n\n\nap j 1992\n2\n5.14145026\n0.01351351\n0.026142873\n\n\nsharpley r 2014\n2\n5.59644301\n0.01408451\n0.026592741\n\n\ngursoy d 2002\n2\n2.44865406\n0.01369863\n0.026429417\n\n\nko dw 2002\n2\n1.29232730\n0.01282051\n0.023390456\n\n\nlee th 2013\n2\n1.20721620\n0.01250000\n0.018861101\n\n\ngursoy d 2004\n2\n0.76257229\n0.01265823\n0.020373880\n\n\nbutler rw 1980\n2\n0.51897650\n0.01282051\n0.014494988\n\n\ndeery m 2012\n2\n3.42371497\n0.01449275\n0.017255742\n\n\nstylidis d 2014\n2\n1.50878773\n0.01250000\n0.018004666\n\n\nmcgehee n. 2004\n2\n1.12598948\n0.01250000\n0.017859792\n\n\nandereck k. 2000\n2\n0.69209167\n0.01298701\n0.017619651\n\n\nperdue rr 1990\n2\n0.97211455\n0.01298701\n0.019061691\n\n\njurowski c. 1997\n2\n0.66331662\n0.01265823\n0.018634125\n\n\nfornell c 1981\n3\n130.44350879\n0.01724138\n0.030052854\n\n\nuysal m 2016\n3\n184.03340996\n0.01754386\n0.021896284\n\n\nhair j.f. 2010\n3\n102.91273019\n0.01754386\n0.024334502\n\n\npodsakoff pm 2003\n3\n27.20448312\n0.01724138\n0.016056964\n\n\nanderson jc 1988\n3\n27.46608210\n0.01724138\n0.015215663\n\n\nhenseler j 2015\n3\n10.50463191\n0.01724138\n0.010678057\n\n\nbagozzi r. 1988\n3\n7.59311784\n0.01639344\n0.011431268\n\n\nnawijn j 2012\n3\n18.21909044\n0.01666667\n0.009656851\n\n\nhu lt 1999\n3\n8.30384124\n0.01562500\n0.010446457\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistoriograph\n\nDescription\n\n\nCo-Citation Network In the co‑citation network, individual documents are represented as nodes and the frequency with which they are cited together forms the links between them. Key metrics—betweenness, closeness, and PageRank—help us gauge the influence and connectivity of each publication.\n\n\nClusters and Influential Works:\n\nThe network reveals several distinct clusters (in our sample, clusters “1”, “2”, and “3”) that represent different intellectual sub-communities within the literature. For example, documents such as Fornell (1981), Uysal (2016), and Hair (2010) in Cluster 3 have exceptionally high betweenness and PageRank scores. These works are central bridging documents that are not only well cited themselves but also frequently cited together with other influential studies. Their high betweenness indicates that they connect diverse parts of the network, suggesting that they serve as foundational references that have shaped multiple strands of research.\n\nCentrality Measures:\n\nBetweenness Centrality shows the role of a document as an intermediary between other works. Higher values (as seen with Fornell and Uysal) imply that these papers act as important conduits through which ideas and methods disseminate. Closeness Centrality indicates how near a document is to all others in the network, with most values clustering in a narrow band. This implies that, while differences exist, the network is relatively compact.\nPageRank reflects the overall “prestige” or influence of a paper. Documents with higher PageRank, particularly in Cluster 3, are influential in the sense that they are cited by other highly cited works.\nOverall, the co‑citation analysis suggests that seminal publications serve as intellectual hubs. They not only anchor their respective subfields but also bridge across them, facilitating the diffusion of ideas in the broader domain of tourism, quality of life, and well‑being research.\n\n\n\nFactorial Analysis on Keywords The factorial analysis on keywords investigates the underlying dimensions that organize the intellectual content of the field. In the provided table:\n\n\nDimensions (Factors):\n\nThe keywords have been projected onto two dimensions (Dim1 and Dim2) that capture patterns of co‑occurrence and semantic similarity across the literature. For instance:\nKeywords such as “quality.of.life”, “perceptions”, “attitudes”, “support”, “impacts” show strong negative loadings on the first dimension. This grouping may represent a critical or evaluative dimension in which the literature focuses on the challenges or complexities of assessing quality of life and subjective well‑being.\nIn contrast, keywords such as “happiness”, “health”, “experiences”, “leisure”, “benefits”, “vacation”, and “positive.psychology” tend to have positive loadings on the first and second dimensions. This pattern suggests a complementary perspective emphasizing the positive and experiential aspects of tourism and its contribution to well‑being.\n\nThematic Grouping:\n\nThe factorial solution appears to cluster together terms that reflect both the evaluative (e.g., perceptions, attitudes, and negative aspects like stress or constraints) and the experiential (e.g., happiness, health, leisure, and benefits) sides of the literature. This dual structure underscores the multidimensionality of research in tourism: while some works scrutinize the challenges and potential negative impacts (or the critical evaluation of quality-of-life metrics), others highlight the positive outcomes and benefits that travel and leisure experiences can offer.\n\nDocument Contributions:\n\nA complementary analysis of documents (Table 2) shows how individual papers load on these dimensions. Papers with strong positive contributions might represent research that emphasizes the uplifting and beneficial outcomes of travel experiences, whereas those with negative loadings may address challenges, limitations, or areas for improvement in assessing tourism’s impact on quality of life.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe combined analyses reveal a rich, interconnected intellectual landscape in tourism and well‑being research:\n\nCo‑citation Network:\n\nThe network structure, through its clusters and centrality measures, indicates that the field is anchored by several seminal works—especially in Cluster 3—that serve as critical hubs linking diverse research streams. These influential documents act as bridges, disseminating ideas across the field and underpinning both methodological and conceptual advances. Meanwhile, other clusters represent more specialized thematic groups that address specific aspects of tourism’s impact on quality of life.\n\nFactorial Analysis on Keywords:\n\nThe keyword analysis uncovers two main dimensions that represent opposing yet complementary perspectives. One dimension is characterized by critical evaluative terms (such as negative perceptions, stress, or constraints) while the other highlights the positive, experiential outcomes (including happiness, health, leisure, and benefits). This duality reflects the inherent complexity of tourism research, where studies balance assessments of both the challenges and the enriching aspects of travel experiences.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTaken together, these analyses demonstrate that tourism research is multifaceted—both in its intellectual structure and in its thematic content. The co‑citation network identifies key publications that have significantly influenced the field and act as linchpins connecting various research areas. Simultaneously, the factorial analysis of keywords reveals a nuanced interplay between critical evaluation and the celebration of positive experiences. Recognizing these patterns can help researchers, practitioners, and policymakers better understand the evolution of the field, identify core literature and emerging trends, and foster further interdisciplinary integration. This comprehensive insight supports more informed decisions in research direction, policy formulation, and the practical application of tourism and well‑being studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper\nTitle\nAuthor_Keywords\nKeywordsPlus\nDOI\nYear\nLCS\nGCS\ncluster\n\n\n\n\nGILBERT D, 2004, ANN TOURISM RES DOI 10.1016/J.ANNALS.2003.06.001\nHOLIDAYTAKING AND THE SENSE OF WELL-BEING\nVACATION; HOLIDAY; WELL-BEING; QUALITY OF LIFE\nPERSONAL STRIVINGS; 5-FACTOR MODEL; SATISFACTION; EXPERIENCE; HAPPINESS; LEISURE; LIFE; LEVEL; HAPPY; SCALE\n&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2003.06.001\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;10.1016/j.annals.2003.06.001&lt;/a&gt;\n2004\n146\n360\n1\n\n\nMCCABE S, 2010, INT J TOUR RES DOI 10.1002/JTR.791\nUNDERSTANDING THE BENEFITS OF SOCIAL TOURISM: LINKING PARTICIPATION TO SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE\nSUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING; QUALITY OF LIFE; TOURISM BENEFITS; SOCIAL TOURISM; SOCIAL POLICY\nINDUSTRY; HOLIDAY; LEISURE; DISABILITY; SERVICES; PATTERNS; UK\n&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/jtr.791\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;10.1002/jtr.791&lt;/a&gt;\n2010\n55\n143\n1\n\n\nSIRGY MJ, 2010, J TRAVEL RES DOI 10.1177/0047287509337416\nTOWARD A QUALITY-OF-LIFE THEORY OF LEISURE TRAVEL SATISFACTION\nQUALITY OF LIFE; WELL-BEING; SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING; LIFE SATISFACTION; LEISURE TRAVEL SATISFACTION; LEISURE WELL-BEING; TOURIST WELL-BEING; GOAL THEORY OF SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING\nPERSONAL STRIVINGS; AMERICAN-DREAM; NEGATIVE AFFECT; MENTAL-HEALTH; WELL; EXPERIENCE; RESOURCES; PERSPECTIVES; ORGANIZATION; INDIVIDUALS\n&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0047287509337416\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;10.1177/0047287509337416&lt;/a&gt;\n2010\n60\n161\n1\n\n\nNAWIJN J, 2010, INT J TOUR RES DOI 10.1002/JTR.756\nTHE HOLIDAY HAPPINESS CURVE: A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INTO MOOD DURING A HOLIDAY ABROAD\nLENGTH OF STAY; LIFE-SATISFACTION; MOOD OF THE DAY; TOURIST EXPERIENCES\nCUSTOMER SATISFACTION; SERVICE QUALITY; EXPERIENCE; TOURISTS; INTENTIONS; EVENTS\n&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/jtr.756\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;10.1002/jtr.756&lt;/a&gt;\n2010\n47\n107\n1\n\n\nNAWIJN J, 2011, J TRAVEL RES DOI 10.1177/0047287510379164\nDETERMINANTS OF DAILY HAPPINESS ON VACATION\nAFFECT; EMOTIONS; HAPPINESS; SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING; TOURIST EXPERIENCE\nCUSTOMER SATISFACTION; MOOD; PERSONALITY; EXPERIENCE; TOURISTS; HEALTH; EXTROVERSION; MINDFULNESS; BENEFITS; LEISURE\n&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0047287510379164\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;10.1177/0047287510379164&lt;/a&gt;\n2011\n73\n176\n1\n\n\nSIRGY MJ, 2011, J TRAVEL RES DOI 10.1177/0047287510362784\nHOW DOES A TRAVEL TRIP AFFECT TOURISTS' LIFE SATISFACTION?\nTOURISTS; SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING; LIFE SATISFACTION; LIFE DOMAIN SATISFACTION; POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT; LEISURE TRAVEL; SENSE OF WELL-BEING\nLEISURE; EXPERIENCE; QUALITY\n&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0047287510362784\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;10.1177/0047287510362784&lt;/a&gt;\n2011\n126\n319\n1\n\n\nANDERECK KL, 2011, J TRAVEL RES DOI 10.1177/0047287510362918\nEXPLORING THE NATURE OF TOURISM AND QUALITY OF LIFE PERCEPTIONS AMONG RESIDENTS\nTOURISM; QUALITY OF LIFE; MEASUREMENT; RESIDENTS; PERCEPTIONS; MEDIATOR EFFECT\nPERCEIVED IMPACTS; HOST PERCEPTIONS; ATTITUDES; COMMUNITY; BENEFITS\n&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0047287510362918\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;10.1177/0047287510362918&lt;/a&gt;\n2011\n180\n559\n1\n\n\nNAWIJN J, 2012, J TRAVEL RES DOI 10.1177/0047287511426482\nRESIDENT ATTITUDES TO TOURISM AND THEIR EFFECT ON SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING: THE CASE OF PALMA DE MALLORCA\nAFFECT; EMOTIONS; HAPPINESS; TOURISM IMPACTS; QUALITY OF LIFE\nLIFE SATISFACTION; SOCIAL IMPACTS; HAPPINESS; PERCEPTIONS; VACATION; HEALTH; EXTROVERSION; PERSONALITY; BENEFITS; BEHAVIOR\n&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0047287511426482\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;10.1177/0047287511426482&lt;/a&gt;\n2012\n64\n117\n1\n\n\nDOLNICAR S, 2012, ANN TOURISM RES DOI 10.1016/J.ANNALS.2011.04.015\nTHE CONTRIBUTION OF VACATIONS TO QUALITY OF LIFE\nQUALITY OF LIFE; LIFE SATISFACTION; VACATIONS; HOLIDAYS; HETEROGENEITY\nLEISURE ACTIVITIES; TOURISM; SATISFACTION; PERSPECTIVES; PERCEPTIONS; INSTRUMENT; RESIDENTS; PATTERNS; SERVICES; INDEX\n&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2011.04.015\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;10.1016/j.annals.2011.04.015&lt;/a&gt;\n2012\n109\n268\n1\n\n\nNAWIJN J, 2013, J TRAVEL RES DOI 10.1177/0047287512465961\nHOW DO WE FEEL ON VACATION?

    "text": "Social Structure\n\nCollaboration Network\nThe given data presents a bibliometric analysis of the author collaboration network on the topic. The metrics included are betweenness, closeness, and PageRank. Let’s delve into an interpretation of the results:\n\nDescription\n\nThe collaboration network represents how authors are connected through co‑authorship relationships. Each node is an individual researcher, and the network is partitioned into several clusters (labeled here by numbers). In this dataset, nodes are characterized by several centrality measures:\n\nBetweenness Centrality: Indicates an author’s role as a “bridge” or connector between otherwise separate parts of the network. High betweenness suggests that an author plays a key role in linking different collaboration groups.\nCloseness Centrality: Reflects how “close” an author is to all other authors in the network. A higher closeness value means that the author is well‑positioned to quickly interact or share information with others.\nPageRank: Captures the overall “influence” or prestige of the author within the network, taking into account not only the number but also the importance of collaborators.\n\nThe network is divided into several clusters (e.g., Cluster 1, Cluster 2, Cluster 3, etc.), suggesting that researchers tend to collaborate within certain groups. For example, Cluster 1 includes nodes like Zhang Y, Gao J, Lee TJ, and Chen CC, while Cluster 2 is characterized by authors such as Kim S, Lee CK, Han H, and Ramkissoon H.\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nKey Connectors and Influencers:\n\n\nZhang Y (Cluster 1) shows the highest betweenness in its cluster (≈72.67), which means that this author often serves as a bridge between otherwise disconnected groups. In addition, a high PageRank (≈0.0346) further underscores Zhang Y’s influential position.\nIn Cluster 2, authors like Kim S, Lee CK, Han H, and Ramkissoon H also have high betweenness values and relatively high closeness scores, indicating that this group is not only tightly knit but also well connected to other parts of the network.\nUysal M in Cluster 10 stands out with a high betweenness of about 74.31 and an impressive PageRank of nearly 0.06, suggesting that Uysal is a central figure in a distinct collaboration sub‑community, acting as both a hub and a bridge to other groups.\n\n\nCluster Characteristics:\n\n\nClusters 1 and 2 appear to be the most densely interconnected, with multiple nodes exhibiting similar closeness and PageRank values. These clusters likely represent established research groups or long‑standing collaborative networks in the field.\nClusters with lower node counts or with nodes showing very low betweenness (for example, some nodes in Clusters 4 or 5 where betweenness is 0) may represent peripheral groups or newer collaborations that are not yet well integrated into the broader network.\n\n\nOverall Connectivity:\n\n\nThe variation in closeness centrality (ranging roughly from 0.005 to 0.012 in most cases) suggests that, on average, authors are not very “distant” from each other—indicating a relatively compact network structure. This compactness can facilitate the rapid dissemination of ideas and collaborative practices across the field.\nPageRank scores, although varying, help identify which authors are cited or recognized frequently by other influential authors. For instance, Uysal M’s relatively high PageRank in Cluster 10 is indicative of his significant impact within that sub-community.\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\nThe collaboration network reveals a multi‑cluster structure, highlighting both well‑established research groups and more peripheral or emerging clusters. Key authors such as Zhang Y (Cluster 1), Kim S (Cluster 2), and Uysal M (Cluster 10) act as critical connectors and influencers within their groups. High betweenness and PageRank values for these nodes indicate that they not only facilitate collaborations within their own clusters but also serve as bridges to other parts of the network. Closeness centrality values show that most authors are relatively near to one another in terms of collaborative reach, reinforcing the notion of a densely interconnected research community.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe analysis of the collaboration network provides valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of research collaboration in this domain. Key findings include:\n\nThe presence of distinct collaboration clusters, each with its own set of influential authors.\nSeveral central figures (high betweenness and PageRank) play pivotal roles in connecting disparate groups, suggesting that fostering collaborations with these individuals could enhance interdisciplinary and cross‑cluster research.\nThe relatively compact nature of the network implies that innovations and methodological advancements can spread rapidly through these collaborations.\n\n\n\nOverall, the collaboration network reflects a vibrant and interconnected research community. By identifying the key players and understanding the collaborative structure, researchers and decision‑makers can better design strategies for knowledge sharing, resource allocation, and the promotion of interdisciplinary studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparams\nvalues\nX3\nX4\n\n\n\n\nlee tj\n1\n29\n6.3291139240506302E-3\n\n\nchen cc\n1\n33.3333333333333\n7.4626865671641798E-3\n\n\npetrick jf\n1\n0\n6.2893081761006301E-3\n\n\nlee j\n1\n0\n5.3475935828877002E-3\n\n\nkim s\n2\n97.846153846153896\n1.0869565217391301E-2\n\n\nlee ck\n2\n79.571428571428598\n9.7087378640776708E-3\n\n\nhan h\n2\n49.571428571428598\n9.7087378640776708E-3\n\n\nramkissoon h\n2\n49.725274725274701\n9.1743119266054999E-3\n\n\nxiao hg\n2\n227\n1.1764705882352899E-2\n\n\nkim j\n2\n180.131868131868\n1.1764705882352899E-2\n\n\nlaw r\n2\n0\n7.5757575757575803E-3\n\n\nwong ia\n2\n0\n8.7719298245613996E-3\n\n\nwang yc\n3\n151.333333333333\n9.1743119266054999E-3\n\n\ncroes r\n3\n0\n6.7567567567567597E-3\n\n\nfu xx\n3\n209.333333333333\n1.0638297872340399E-2\n\n\nridderstaat j\n3\n43\n8.4033613445378096E-3\n\n\nfyall a\n3\n4.6666666666666696\n7.4626865671641798E-3\n\n\nalrawadieh z\n4\n0\n1\n\n\naltinay l\n4\n0\n1\n\n\nsthapit e\n5\n0\n1\n\n\nbjörk p\n5\n0\n1\n\n\nrasoolimanesh sm\n6\n29\n7.09219858156028E-3\n\n\njaafar m\n6\n0\n5.8823529411764696E-3\n\n\nwoosnam km\n7\n109.153846153846\n8.7719298245613996E-3\n\n\npinto p\n7\n0\n7.0422535211267599E-3\n\n\nboley bb\n7\n0\n7.0422535211267599E-3\n\n\nsu lj\n8\n2\n0.25\n\n\nnawijn j\n8\n2\n0.25\n\n\nmitas o\n8\n0\n0.16666666666666699\n\n\nhuang ss\n8\n0\n0.16666666666666699\n\n\nfilep s\n9\n2\n0.33333333333333298\n\n\nvada s\n9\n0\n0.25\n\n\nwu my\n9\n0\n0.2\n\n\nmackenzie sh\n9\n0\n0.25\n\n\nuysal m\n10\n74.314285714285703\n1.02040816326531E-2\n\n\nkim h\n10\n15.685714285714299\n9.4339622641509396E-3\n\n\nsirgy mj\n10\n0\n7.9365079365079395E-3\n\n\nberbekova a\n10\n0\n7.9365079365079395E-3\n\n\ngursoy d\n10\n0\n7.9365079365079395E-3\n\n\nchen y\n11\n0\n6.7567567567567597E-3\n\n\nlehto xy\n11\n29\n8.4033613445378096E-3\n\n\nprayag g\n12\n0\n1\n\n\njordan ej\n12\n0\n1\n\n\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountries’ Collaboration World Map\nThe dataset offers a broad view of the collaborations between countries in the field. The frequencies indicate the number of times scholars from two countries have co-authored papers. In this case, the majority of collaborations have a frequency of 1, meaning that many pairs of countries have collaborated once.\n\nDescription\n\n\nHigh-Frequency Links\n\n\nChina → USA (91 collaborations) is by far the most frequently observed connection, indicating a very strong research or project link between these two countries.\nChina → Australia (65) and Australia → United Kingdom (14) also stand out, suggesting that these triads (China–USA, China–Australia, and Australia–UK) form a major hub of collaboration.\nThe United Kingdom → South Africa (15) and Australia → South Africa (11) links highlight substantial ties between parts of Europe, Oceania, and Africa.\n\n\nRegional Clusters\n\n\nThe table shows many intra-Asia or Asia–Pacific collaborations: for instance, Australia with various Asia-Pacific nations (e.g., Malaysia, New Zealand, Korea) and China with countries like Korea, Malaysia, and Japan.\nThere are also strong Europe-based clusters. For instance, Finland has multiple connections to Germany, Sweden, Estonia, etc., and Spain has multiple links across Europe (Portugal, France, Germany, etc.).\n\n\nNorth–South Collaborations\n\n\nThe data indicates many cross-hemisphere partnerships, such as: USA collaborating with countries in Africa (South Africa, Ghana, Egypt) and Latin America (Mexico, Chile).\nUnited Kingdom partnering with countries in Asia (India, Malaysia, Thailand), the Middle East (Oman, Saudi Arabia), and Africa (South Africa, Ghana).\n\n\nNotable Emerging Collaborations\n\n\nSome countries that might not be as frequently highlighted in global research contexts appear here with multiple ties, e.g., Pakistan, Oman, and Rwanda, each collaborating with various countries.\nCountries such as Vietnam and Indonesia show collaborations across multiple continents, including Europe, Asia, and Oceania.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nMajor Global Hubs\n\nUSA, China, Australia, and the United Kingdom appear to be central hubs in this network. They have numerous high-frequency links spanning different continents, suggesting a broad international footprint in collaborative work.\n\nStrong Asia–Pacific Ties\n\nCollaboration among China, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, and others in this region is robust. This reflects a well-connected research environment in the Asia–Pacific.\n\nEurope’s Multiple Clusters\n\nMany European countries (e.g., Finland, Germany, Spain, Portugal) have wide-reaching collaborations both within Europe and internationally (Latin America, Africa, and Asia).\n\nAfrica’s Rising Presence\n\nSouth Africa stands out as a key collaborator in Africa, linking with the UK, USA, Malaysia, Norway, and more. There are also smaller but noteworthy collaborations involving countries like Ghana, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Mauritius.\n\nOpportunities for New Links\n\nWhile some country pairs show strong existing collaboration, others appear only once, indicating potential for expansion. Low-frequency edges might be starting points for growing cross-national research partnerships.\n\n\n\nConclusion & Summary\n\n\nThis collaboration dataset reveals a complex, global network of partnerships. Certain countries, such as China, USA, Australia, and the United Kingdom, dominate with many high-frequency collaborations. Regions like Asia–Pacific and Europe show strong intra-regional and inter-regional links, while African and Latin American countries also appear as strategic partners in multiple contexts.\nOverall, the data underscores the highly interconnected nature of global research and project collaborations. It can guide future policy decisions, research funding, and institution-level strategies aiming to foster international partnerships and bridge any existing gaps in the global network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom\nTo\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\nCANADA\n3\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\nCHILE\n3\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\nIRAN\n3\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\nKOREA\n5\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\nMALAYSIA\n15\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\nMAURITIUS\n3\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\nNEW ZEALAND\n10\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\nSOUTH AFRICA\n11\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\nSPAIN\n3\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\nTHAILAND\n4\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\nUNITED KINGDOM\n14\n\n\nAUSTRALIA\nVIETNAM\n3\n\n\nCHINA\nAUSTRALIA\n65\n\n\nCHINA\nAUSTRIA\n4\n\n\nCHINA\nCANADA\n10\n\n\nCHINA\nFRANCE\n3\n\n\nCHINA\nGHANA\n4\n\n\nCHINA\nINDONESIA\n3\n\n\nCHINA\nJAPAN\n4\n\n\nCHINA\nKOREA\n32\n\n\nCHINA\nMALAYSIA\n11\n\n\nCHINA\nNETHERLANDS\n4\n\n\nCHINA\nNEW ZEALAND\n10\n\n\nCHINA\nNORWAY\n3\n\n\nCHINA\nPAKISTAN\n6\n\n\nCHINA\nSINGAPORE\n8\n\n\nCHINA\nSOUTH AFRICA\n11\n\n\nCHINA\nSPAIN\n3\n\n\nCHINA\nUNITED KINGDOM\n36\n\n\nCHINA\nUSA\n91\n\n\nFINLAND\nSWEDEN\n3\n\n\nFRANCE\nIRAN\n3\n\n\nGERMANY\nSWITZERLAND\n3\n\n\nITALY\nNETHERLANDS\n3\n\n\nKOREA\nJAPAN\n3\n\n\nKOREA\nMALAYSIA\n5\n\n\nKOREA\nSOUTH AFRICA\n4\n\n\nMALAYSIA\nFINLAND\n3\n\n\nMALAYSIA\nSOUTH AFRICA\n7\n\n\nNETHERLANDS\nFINLAND\n4\n\n\nNEW ZEALAND\nFINLAND\n3\n\n\nNEW ZEALAND\nMALAYSIA\n4\n\n\nNEW ZEALAND\nSWEDEN\n3\n\n\nPAKISTAN\nSAUDI ARABIA\n3\n\n\nPORTUGAL\nBRAZIL\n6\n\n\nRUSSIA\nSERBIA\n4\n\n\nSOUTH AFRICA\nGHANA\n4\n\n\nSOUTH AFRICA\nMAURITIUS\n3\n\n\nSOUTH AFRICA\nNORWAY\n4\n\n\nSOUTH AFRICA\nSWEDEN\n3\n\n\nSPAIN\nCHILE\n3\n\n\nSPAIN\nITALY\n4\n\n\nSPAIN\nKOREA\n3\n\n\nSPAIN\nMALAYSIA\n3\n\n\nSPAIN\nPORTUGAL\n6\n\n\nTURKEY\nSOUTH AFRICA\n6\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nAUSTRIA\n4\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nEGYPT\n3\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nFINLAND\n4\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nFRANCE\n5\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nINDIA\n3\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nIRAN\n3\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nITALY\n3\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nKOREA\n4\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nMALAYSIA\n9\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nNETHERLANDS\n6\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nNEW ZEALAND\n6\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nNORWAY\n9\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nOMAN\n3\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nPORTUGAL\n5\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nSERBIA\n3\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nSINGAPORE\n3\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nSOUTH AFRICA\n15\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nSPAIN\n4\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nSWEDEN\n3\n\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\nTURKEY\n7\n\n\nUSA\nAUSTRALIA\n18\n\n\nUSA\nCANADA\n9\n\n\nUSA\nCHILE\n3\n\n\nUSA\nGERMANY\n5\n\n\nUSA\nINDIA\n5\n\n\nUSA\nITALY\n3\n\n\nUSA\nJAPAN\n4\n\n\nUSA\nKOREA\n40\n\n\nUSA\nMALAYSIA\n5\n\n\nUSA\nMEXICO\n4\n\n\nUSA\nNETHERLANDS\n7\n\n\nUSA\nNEW ZEALAND\n4\n\n\nUSA\nNORWAY\n3\n\n\nUSA\nPERU\n3\n\n\nUSA\nPOLAND\n4\n\n\nUSA\nPORTUGAL\n5\n\n\nUSA\nSOUTH AFRICA\n24\n\n\nUSA\nSPAIN\n6\n\n\nUSA\nTHAILAND\n3\n\n\nUSA\nTURKEY\n8\n\n\nUSA\nUNITED KINGDOM\n27"

    "section": "Discussion of the bibliometrics",
    "text": "Discussion of the bibliometrics\nThe analysis report (Chae, 2025a) offers a comprehensive bibliometric examination of the literature on tourists’ experiences and happiness. It employs performance indicators, co-citation analyses, and thematic mappings to reveal publication trends, identify influential authors and journals, and elucidate the conceptual and intellectual structures that define this research domain. Overall, it shows an initial, gradual increase in publications in the early 2000s, followed by a sharp rise in recent years, signaling widespread scholarly and societal interest in how tourism intersects with well-being. Older publications consistently demonstrate higher citation counts, reflecting their foundational impact. Key journals such as Tourism Management, Journal of Travel Research, and Journal of Sustainable Tourism play a central role in disseminating significant findings, while researchers like Uysal, Filep, and Kim appear repeatedly as leading figures, suggesting a concentration of expertise and influence. The analysis also highlights extensive international collaboration—spanning China, the United States, and Australia—underscoring the global scope of tourism research and the multifaceted ways it addresses quality of life, subjective well-being, and holistic travel experiences. Two principal thematic clusters emerge. One focuses on macro-level constructs such as quality of life, community impacts, and satisfaction, while the other centers on micro-level, traveler-centric themes such as health, happiness, and experiential outcomes. Factor analysis adds nuance to these findings, indicating that hedonic (pleasure-oriented) and eudaimonic (meaning-oriented) perspectives both occupy prominent positions in scholarly discussions of tourist well-being.\n\nRelevant Arguments Findings shows emphasizing the need to move beyond tourism’s economic or recreational aspects and to integrate subjective well-being and life satisfaction into the scholarly lens. The proposal advocates a holistic, interdisciplinary framework that brings together psychology, economics, sociology, and management to study hedonic and eudaimonic aspects. Similarly, the analysis report indicates that tourism studies are increasingly investigating subjective constructs such as quality of life, satisfaction, and happiness, although these efforts sometimes remain fragmented and isolated. Both sources suggest that comprehensive research on tourism and happiness has the potential to shape more robust policies, industry practices, and cross-disciplinary collaborations that can improve overall quality of life for travelers and host communities.\nResearch Questions and Finidngs\n\nRQ1: Do Tourism Experiences Enhance Subjective Well-Being? The proposal posits that tourism positively influences subjective well-being, asserting that travel boosts happiness and life satisfaction. The analysis report (Chae, 2025a) confirms that many studies document heightened happiness around trips, a phenomenon sometimes termed the “vacation effect.” It does, however, highlight that this uplift may be short-lived, with happiness levels eventually reverting to baseline. Nonetheless, it also notes that certain meaningful or “eudaimonic” travel experiences can create deeper and longer-lasting gains. These findings validate the proposal’s fundamental assumption about a positive tourism–happiness link but also stress that duration and intensity of the benefit depend on how and why people travel.\nRQ2: Which Factors in Tourism Experiences Most Influence Happiness? The proposal underscores factors like destination quality, enjoyment, and safety as primary drivers of tourist happiness. In alignment with this view, the bibliometric analysis pinpoints environmental quality, destination image, risk perception, and authenticity of the travel experience as central to well-being (Chae, 2025a). Overcrowding is identified as a negative influence, especially under conditions of overtourism. In addition, the discussion of safety—particularly in light of global health events—underscores the importance of contextual variables. These observations reinforce the proposal’s argument while broadening its scope: beyond mere enjoyment or good service, factors like social environment and health-related safeguards are indispensable for ensuring a truly satisfying trip.\nRQ3: How Do Scholars Conceptualize and Measure Tourist Happiness? The proposal suggests a positive-psychology framework incorporating both hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions. The analysis report (Chae, 2025a) shows that the field largely adopts Diener’s (1984) Subjective Well-Being constructs, blending positive affect, negative affect, and cognitive life satisfaction. Measures such as the Life Satisfaction Scale frequently appear, reflecting a primarily subjective, survey-based methodology. Many researchers also explore deeper, purpose-driven experiences, thus affirming the proposal’s view that happiness is more than a fleeting emotion; rather, it can involve personal growth and meaning. These findings confirm that tourism scholars prioritize psychological scales and models of well-being, lending empirical support to the proposal’s approach.\nRQ4: What Are the Major Research Gaps and Future Directions? The proposal argues that tourism-happiness research remains fragmented and requires interdisciplinary integration. The bibliometric analysis confirms this fragmentation while identifying trends such as sustainability, technology-driven experiences, and global risk factors (Chae, 2025a). Sustainability issues appear increasingly central, as do the psychological and behavioral effects of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging questions also concern digital tourism and how online platforms can shape or mediate tourist well-being. These gaps and emerging foci echo the proposal’s call for an integrative framework that spans economics, sociology, public health, and psychology. The analysis thereby extends the proposal’s recommendations by highlighting specific under-studied domains—particularly the long-term psychological consequences of travel disruptions and the evolving influence of virtual reality on tourist experiences.\n\n\n\nDiscussio Points\n\nRelevant Arguments:\nBoth documents assert that tourism goes well beyond its traditional role as a recreational or economic activity. The analysis report demonstrates—with extensive performance, network, and thematic mapping analyses—that research in tourism is increasingly concerned with how travel experiences shape subjective well-being, quality of life, and overall happiness. In parallel, the proposal argues that the field remains fragmented, with isolated studies examining hedonic (pleasure-focused) versus eudaimonic (meaning-focused) aspects. Together, they build a case for a more holistic understanding of tourism’s multifaceted impact on human well-being. This perspective is essential as it calls for integrating both psychological and socio-economic dimensions to inform policy, practice, and further academic inquiry.\n\n\nPotential Research Questions:\nDrawing on the identified gaps and emerging trends, several research questions naturally arise: • How do distinct travel experiences differentially influence hedonic and eudaimonic well-being? • What psychological mechanisms mediate the relationship between tourism and overall quality of life? • In what ways do demographic, cultural, and digital factors (e.g., the role of virtual reality) moderate the impact of tourism on happiness? • How can integrated bibliometric and qualitative methodologies further refine our understanding of the evolving intellectual structure in tourism research?\n\n\nInterdisciplinary Implications:\nBoth documents highlight the inherently interdisciplinary nature of studying tourism and happiness. By merging perspectives from positive psychology, economics, sociology, and management, the research field is poised to develop richer, more nuanced models of well-being. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances theoretical development but also offers practical benefits for policymakers and industry stakeholders. For example, insights from the analysis report—through network and factorial analyses—show how diverse academic traditions intersect, suggesting that collaboration across fields can drive innovations in both tourism experience design and well-being enhancement.\n\n\nMethodological Challenges and Innovations:\nA recurring theme is the challenge of synthesizing a fragmented literature that spans multiple disciplines and employs varied methodologies. One of the main challenges is operationalizing subjective constructs like happiness and well-being in a standardized and comparable way. On the innovation front, the proposal advocates for a combination of bibliometric methods, qualitative content analysis, and machine-learning techniques (such as structural topic modeling) to map research trends and uncover latent intellectual structures. The analysis report further demonstrates how network analyses (co-citation, bibliographic coupling) and factorial analyses can reveal the underpinnings of tourism research. These methodological innovations not only help in capturing complex interrelations but also pave the way for more robust, data-driven evaluations of how tourism contributes to happiness."

    "text": "Conclusion of the bibliometrics analysis\n\nThe bibliometric analysis report and the research proposal collectively illuminate a maturing yet still evolving scholarly landscape. A core consensus emerges that tourism experiences do, in fact, enhance happiness, albeit through varying degrees of hedonic and eudaimonic pathways. The field’s conceptual and methodological foundations rest upon well-established positive-psychology measures, although new lines of inquiry—such as sustainability, risk perception, and digital transformation—point to a broader, interdisciplinary perspective. Both documents underscore the importance of situating tourism within a more holistic, life-satisfaction context that accounts for cultural, social, and psychological complexities. The analysis confirms the proposal’s argument that tourism research now recognizes human well-being as a crucial outcome of travel experiences, but it also reveals areas where research remains patchy, calling for innovative, data-driven methods and collaborative theoretical models. By uniting insights from the proposal’s theoretical roadmap with the analysis report’s empirical mapping, scholars and practitioners can more effectively harness tourism’s potential to foster and sustain human happiness in a rapidly changing global environment.\nIn conclusion, findings converge on the need for a comprehensive, integrative approach to studying the relationship between tourism and happiness. The relevant arguments call for moving beyond narrow, isolated studies toward a multidimensional framework that accounts for both immediate and lasting impacts on well-being. Future research should address the proposed questions, embrace interdisciplinary methodologies, and overcome challenges related to data standardization and integration. Together, these efforts can deepen our understanding of tourism’s transformative potential for enhancing quality of life, guiding both academic research and practical interventions in the tourism industry."
